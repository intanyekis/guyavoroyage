A Netflix original that's also made some appearances in theaters, this film is one that everyone is talking about. The sequel to the 2019 critically acclaimed movie Knives Out, it only features one star from its predecessor in Daniel Craig.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Are Critics Saying About Knives Out 2?</a></span>Seeing as the film features an ensemble cast, how much money exactly have its actors made? With blockbuster names such as Kate Hudson, Edward Norton and Daniel Craig, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that the total net worth of all combined cast members is over $500 million. Here's how much each cast member has individually made, and how they rank among each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-madelyn-cline-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Much Is Madelyn Cline Worth?</span></h2><p>Starting off the list is Madelyn Cline. She's reportedly worth less than $1 million.</p><p>The least experienced member of the main cast, it's no surprise she's last on this last. This is her first major acting role. With that being said, if she continues to act this well and can get some more roles in big movies, she could certainly become a star someday soon.</p><h2 id=what-is-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-star-kathryn-hahn-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Is Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery Star Kathryn Hahn Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kathryn isn't the biggest star on the list, and her net worth somewhat represents that, as she is worth $3 million. However, that does not mean she doesn't have any star or acting power. She's a very talented and unrecognized actress who, after appearances in WandaVision and Glass Onion, could easily turn into a household name.</p><h2 id=what-is-janelle-monae-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Is Janelle Monae's Net Worth?</span></h2><p>From this point on in the list, the cast consists of some real stars. It's insane that Janelle is so low on the list, as she is worth $12 million. She's gotten this money from other movies such as Hidden Figures and Moonlight.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Janelle Monae Remembers The Last Time She Met Chadwick Boseman Before He Died</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's also made money from her music career. One of the few stars who's excelled in both music and acting, she's made a lot of money and has had a lot of critical success in both fields. The movies she's acted in have been nominated for Oscars. Some of her albums have been nominated for Best Album at the Grammy's. It's very, very clear that Janelle is beyond talented.</p><h2 id=how-much-glass-onion-s-dave-bautista-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Glass Onion's Dave Bautista Worth?</span></h2><p>Dave has racked up $16 million over the years. He started off as a famous wrestler, and eventually worked his way to a major role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Drax the Destroyer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Bautista Knows Why Daniel Craig Was Unhappy While Playing 007</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dave's really improved his life in a lot of ways. When he came to Hollywood, he was already rich but had been living a bad lifestyle. He controlled his spending abruptly in a way most wealthy people don't, in order to improve his health and keep himself from going broke. And before all of that, Dave actually grew up poor. He had what he describes as <a href=#>a "difficult" childhood</a>, which goes to show that anyone can make it out of dark times.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-much-ethan-hawke-is-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>This Is How Much Ethan Hawke Is Worth</span></h2><p>An A-list actor, Ethan has accumulated an estimated $50 million over the years.</p><p>Ethan's role in Glass Onion is seemingly more a cameo than anything else. He plays an assistant who sprays people for a plot specific purpose. His name is on the main billing, but the movie did not advertise him at all. This has led to a huge fan theory before the movie releases that perhaps his character will play either an important part in the film, or a very minor one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-glass-onion-star-kate-hudson-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Is Glass Onion Star Kate Hudson Worth?</span></h2><p>Kate Hudson has an astounding $80 million net worth.</p><p>Kate hasn't said much about being in the movie. With the whole plot being kept hush by the filmmakers and actors, that isn't much of a surprise. She did say however that her character Birdie Jay has a "fabulous" wardrobe.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-knives-out-2-star-daniel-craig-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Is Knives Out 2 Star Daniel Craig Worth?</span></h2><p>As the face of the James Bond franchise over the last two decades, it's no surprise that Daniel has racked up a lot of money. He is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an apparent $160 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'd think that a superstar like Daniel Craig would naturally be the richest actor in whatever movie he stars in. This was the case with the first Knives Out movie, where he was <a href=#>the highest-paid member of the main cast</a>. With its sequel, however, it is not the truth.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-edward-norton-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Is Edward Norton Worth?</span></h2><p>Impressively enough, Edward Norton has the highest net worth from the cast of Glass Onion. He's only really starred in two major blockbuster films, Fight Club and The Incredible Hulk. He's made a name from a number of other critically acclaimed films, but none of them have been too huge at the box office. Despite that, he has amassed a giant fortune of $300 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the New York Times, Ed's actually maneuvered over to the technology industry. As it's one of the highest growing industries in the economic world, it's no surprise he's been able to make his acting money grow into something bigger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWajnp7Dpr%2BMqKytZWJitK2t0qxkqKaZpLtuusStZLCnoqm1br7Ap6KenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sisanie-reategui.html><span>←</span><span>Sisanie Reategui Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
