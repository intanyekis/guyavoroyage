She also included a lengthy pregnancy announcement note. According to the automatic translation, she wrote:</strong></p><p><strong>“How I wish I could convey this news…! How I wish I could touch my stomach and feel someone blossoming inside of me… Today, it has become a reality, and I am ecstatic. I am certain that God is responsible for this miracle. and that it has always gone hand in hand with him…!”</strong></p><p>Charry, her husband Sebastián, and his daughter Zoe again praised God.</p><h2>Tanya Charry’s marriage and spouse</h2><p>Sebastián Jiménez is a British film and television producer who is best known for his contributions to Run Coyote Run, Betty en NY, Model Latina, and Now and Again, among other works.</p><p>Tanya Charry and Jimenez met for the first time in 2019 when Jimenez approached the renowned journalist via Instagram direct message. He indicated a desire to see Charry, but his message initially got lost in her chat box.</p><p>A mutual buddy then acquainted the couple and set them up on a blind date at the Caviar Russe restaurant in Miami. The meeting was successful, and they remained in contact for several months.</p><p>Tanya was introduced to Zoe, Sebastián’s 10-year-old daughter, shortly thereafter. In 2018, he became a widower and has been a single parent since then. The several months that Sebastián, Zoe, and Tanya Charry spent in lockdown together cemented their friendship.</p><p>Jiménez proposed to Tanya on national television in July 2020, as she was ending her program, as she was concluding her program. The couple got engaged that day.</p><p>The pair wed in a private family ceremony at St. High Church in Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida, on August 7, 2021. Tanya Charry revealed on her Univision program in July 2022 to Argentine actor Julián Gil that she had frozen her eggs years prior and initiated the in vitro fertilization process in February of this year.</p><p>It was a therapy that we administered in Los Angeles. The 47-year-old revealed her pregnancy during Wednesday’s broadcast of El Gordo y la Flaca to program hosts Lili Estefan and Ral de Molina (via El Diario). She stated:</p><p><strong>“I’ve always wanted to make this announcement: I’m expecting a child. It’s been a long process; I’ve always wanted to be a mother and even tried to adopt a kid when I was single, but it was difficult… I applied to be a “foster mom,” but I never heard back from them. Things in existence… I believe now was the perfect time because I had a gorgeous spouse and a wonderful family that I adore.”</strong></p><p>Tanya Charry is already 16 weeks pregnant. The Colombian journalist began her television career in 2001 on Escándalo TV as a renowned Latino entertainment correspondent.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>journalist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Adam Nagourney</a></h3>Adam Nagourney estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
