The “Perfect Illusion” singer, 30, isn’t promoting her upcoming album, <i>Joanne</i>, in her typical outlandish outfits of yesteryear (like the meat dress or the bubble frock). Instead, the Grammy winner is sticking to the simpler things. &nbsp;</p><p>“To be frank, I would just prefer to go through this album cycle and talk about my music. That’d be great,” she told The <i>London Times</i>‘ <i></i><a href=#><i>Culture</i> magazine</a> of her fifth album, out October 21. “It becomes about everything else, and that was what I [once] wanted. But if I wear a black T-shirt and black pants every day, [people] might listen to what I write. All the outfits, fashion and art pieces over the years made sense to me. They didn’t make sense to other people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lady-gaga-02-9109fc49-5440-4cdc-8e6b-9168e06f889d.jpg><p>Despite the criticism, the stares, the memes and the tweets, she still held on to that creative license. “I always got it. It was an expression, not a hiding,” she explained. “This time, my style just stayed naturally at how I’ve been in the studio. I started vehemently saying, ‘Get these clothes out! I’m not wearing this! I’m not wearing heels!’ And some of that, too, is because I’ve been in the studio with boys. You can’t make music with a bunch of boys who are staring at a lobster on your head. They are going to get distracted.”</p><span class=caption></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lady-gaga00-7f7afc91-6766-4778-8072-fa6fa2e9d956.jpg><p>Gaga’s collaborators, who include <b>Mark Ronson</b> and <b>Beck</b>, have allowed her to create music that speaks to everyone, not just her fans and fellow eccentric art school kids (she studied at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts). This time, she was thinking of “this woman in middle America with hair pulled back, no makeup and jewelry heirlooms from her family, a sweatshirt you’d buy at the drugstore, a kid in one hand, pinot grigio in the other, two kids running around, you don’t know if she’s married. But she’s at my show, crying her eyes out because she feels I’m speaking for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lady-gaga-1922703f-787e-4c62-8f40-ab58acfe5a35.jpg><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6GupcWMoJigmV2nsrexwKWqZq%2BYrnq0tMRmq6imlZl6pbvWp2ShnaJiwLXFy55ksGxkaoBzhI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-durant-achilles-injury-reactions-653177.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Durant's Injury Sparks Reactions From NBA Players</span></a>
