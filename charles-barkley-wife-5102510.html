Following his athletic retirement, “Sir Charles” was then welcomed into America’s living rooms as a hilarious TV sports analyst on TNT and CBS Sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Charles-Barkley-Wife-Maureen-Blumhardt-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The man, the myth and the legend would be just as beloved by his wife,<strong> Maureen Blumhardt</strong>. The pair have been married for over three decades and still going strong. Let’s meet the gorgeous lady, who doesn’t have an Instagram or social media presence, but can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>here</strong></a>, below.</p><h2>What Does Maureen Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Charles met Maureen, reportedly after one of his games, she was coming off a successful modeling career. After their marriage, she became very much involved with humanitarian efforts such as the Fresh Start Women’s Foundation, according to their <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>.</p><h2>When Did They Get Hitched</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy, playful 29th <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#WeddingAnniversary</a> wishes to NBA legend Charles Barkley and his wife Maureen! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Brides</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Wedding</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Invitations</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Stationery</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#IvoryIsleDesigns</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/yGZUUewCb7</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Josie Helmstetter (@IvoryIsleDesign) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 9, 2018</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Charles and Maureen had a brief courting period and made it official in 1989. They also welcomed their only child that year, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter </a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christiana Barkley.</a></strong>The proud papa previously revealed that his daughter’s first name was inspired by Christiana Mall in Delaware, in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>episode of his podcast</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Steam Room</a>. “There’s a Christiana Mall in Delaware that I used to always go by. That’s how she got her name, Christiana,” he said. When Ernie asked him, “Why?,” he hilariously answered, “I don’t know. I just like the mall.”</p><h2>Secret To Their Marriage</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Staying together for over 3 decades is quite a feat for Hollywood folk. Charles even joked that the one “secret” to his long, successful marriage is that he’s gone all the time. “Well, No. 1 I’m gone a lot. That always helps,” he quipped in a 2021 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a> interview, before adding, “I think the main reason is she accepts my flaws and all. She doesn’t judge me, accepts me how I am, she’s a great mother.”</p><h2>Madonna Almost Came Between Them</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Maureen Blumhardt, Charles Barkley’s Wife: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know – <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/rNIDYjmNIM</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/k3cEjVjrjz</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— Happy Day 24 (@CryptoTech24) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 11, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As super fans know, their romance was almost thwarted by rumors of a Charles and Madonna fling!&nbsp;During the 1993&nbsp;NBA Finals, rumors started to swirl that Sir Charles was canoodling with superstar <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madonna</strong></a>. Even after Charles denied it, the rumor would not go away. At one point, the star believed the incident caused his mother-in-law to suffer a heart attack. according to the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Chicago Tribune</a>.&nbsp; “She (his mother-in-law) has had a lot of stress from the jokes about me and Madonna (dating) and has been harassed with people (media) calling the house,” Charles told the outlet in June 1993. “She’s not doing well right now and that’s a major concern. I only met her (Madonna) one time when she was in Phoenix. We don’t date. We don’t have a relationship.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“They should leave my wife and daughter alone. When my wife goes out, they play Madonna songs, they’re calling my in-laws. This stuff is ridiculous, unbelievable,” he continued. “Nothing happened. I’m trying to concentrate on the finals, but this is harassment of me and my family.” Charles and the Phoenix Suns would go on to lose to <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> and the Chicago Bulls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhmKuklah6o63RpKOesV2stqexjG5oaWplZn1w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alfred-taubman-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alfred Taubman Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
