The deal included&nbsp;hits like&nbsp;Changes, Space Oddity, Rebel Rebel, Ziggy Stardust, and his infamous 1981 collaboration with Queen, Under Pressure.</p><p>In a statement confirming the news on Monday, Warner Chappell Music Co-Chair and CEO Guy Moot said: "His work spanned massive pop hits and experimental adventures that have inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media. We are looking forward to tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care as we strive to build on the legacy of this most extraordinary human being.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Red Hot Chili Peppers Sell Song Catalog for $140 Million</a></span></p><p>According to Variety, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the deal doesn't include everything</a>. Bowie's estate only owned his catalog from 1968 forward, so some of the songwriter's earliest officially released material wasn't part of the deal. The missing material not owned by Warner Chappel Music includes&nbsp;a string of early singles and one self-titled 1967 album.</p><p>The deal comes just weeks after fellow artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice T took to Twitter to call the China Girl singer a 'real one.'</a> The remark was in response to&nbsp;a clip from a 1993 interview that recently&nbsp;resurfaced in which&nbsp;the singer called out MTV for not playing black artists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The deal is just the latest in a string of deals that have seen the valuation of song catalogs soar to once unimaginable levels. In 2020, Bob Dylan&nbsp;sold his song catalog to Universal Music Publishing <a href=#>for between $300-400 million</a>, Neil Young sold half of his to newcomer&nbsp;Hipgnosis Songs for $100 million, and Stevie Nicks sold hers to Primary Wave for $100 million.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen proved, however, that he's still the boss when he<a href=#> sold his catalog&nbsp;to Sony Music for a jaw-dropping&nbsp;$500 million</a> just last month.</p><p>The thought of selling song catalogs remains unthinkable to many artists because it's where many of them earn the most money. But many older musicians are opting to trade over the complicated asset for a large amount of cash for estate planning reasons.</p><p>READ NEXT: <a href=#>David Bowie: 10 Things You Didn't Know About The King Of Glam Rock</a></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxosLInWSbp6eesrR5xKeroqqVYrq2v8icZJyZpJa5sLPUnmSsp5yZerW7jLCYq6aVp3qktMCpnKWklWK6tr%2FInGSfp6Jif3Z8jKagpaSZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-bryan-boy-husband-age-difference-wedding-and-family-370757-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Bryan Boy Husband?
