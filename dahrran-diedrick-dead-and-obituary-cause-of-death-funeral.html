The Montreal Alouettes, with whom he won two Grey Cups in the CFL, made the announcement of his passing through his family.</span></p><p><span>He was raised in Toronto and was born in Jamaica. He went to the University of Nebraska, where he was a standout running back for the Cornhuskers. He was the first student-athlete from Canada to be awarded a scholarship through the program. After finishing his college career, he was first chosen for the San Diego Chargers’ practice squad in 2003 before being signed by the Green Bay Packers the following year.</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-49486 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dahrran-Diedrick-Dead-and-Obituary-Cause-Of-Death-Funeral.png alt="Dahrran Diedrick Dead and Obituary, Cause Of Death, Funeral" width=702 height=466 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-49486 class=wp-caption-text>Dahrran Diedrick Dead and Obituary, Cause Of Death, Funeral</p><p><span>But he only participated in one regular-season NFL game while a member of the Washington team, where he appeared. He crossed the border in 2005 and joined the Canadian Football League (CFL), where he enjoyed notable success, taking home three Grey Cup titles.</span></p><p><strong><span>READ ALSO: <span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kim Kardashian Look Alike Christina Ashten Gourkani Cause Of Death</a></span></span></strong></p><p><span>Dahrran Diedrick joined the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL after leaving Washington. He earned his first Grey Cup while he was a player for them in 2005. He was, however, only a minor player at the time and was let go in 2006. He afterwards joined the Montreal Alouettes, who they had defeated in the championship game.</span></p><p><span>He remained with them until 2013, when he experienced the greatest degree of consistency in success. He won the Grey Cup twice more in 2009 and 2010 during that time. He played with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 2013 before returning to Montreal for one last season in 2014. Over the course of 130 CFL regular-season games, Dahrran Diedrick carried the ball 179 times for 872 yards and six touchdowns.</span></p><p><span>He experienced his first health concern at that time. His liver and spleen were found to have T-cell lymphoma. He was discovered to have an enlarged spleen in 2015. He had to go through several cycles of chemotherapy to become better. The only known treatment for the illness with which he was diagnosed is a stem cell transplant. Fortunately for him, Dominique could serve as the donor.</span></p><p><span>His initial therapy was effective, and in 2017 he at last felt good enough to play again. This season, he worked as the Toronto Argonauts’ strength and conditioning coach.</span></p><p><span>Long-term, he was unable to prevent the health issues brought on by cancer, nevertheless. On June 24, 2023, he passed away in the Toronto General Hospital.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGibmqCip66vecOinJ2qmZi4brDEmptmmZ6ZerCuyK2smqqpYrCiwdKeZKieXZmyosDHZp2uppWnrq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clara-kushnir.html><span>←</span><span>Clara Kushnir</span></a>
