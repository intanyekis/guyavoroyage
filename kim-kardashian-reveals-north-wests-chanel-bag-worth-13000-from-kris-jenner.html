She was pregnant at the time and was both excited to meet Lagerfeld, but also for the possible gift because “rumor had it” that “he’ll give you a bag on set if it’s like your first photo shoot with him.” Kim added, “I was so excited, I was like dreaming about what kind of bag he was going to give me.”</p><p>But when Kris walked into the shoot wearing head-to-toe vintage Chanel, Kim—Kris’ eldest daughter—called it an “over-the-top” look. Kris' outfit included boots, gloves, headband, hat and glasses. She was also wearing a fanny pack and a bag.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Scooter Braun Will Pay Ex-Wife Yael Cohen $20 Million And Give $60,000 A Month For Child Support</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Hollywood life, Kim said, “So he falls in love with her.”</p><p>“Doesn’t hardly even acknowledge that I’ve been like, you know, sitting there.

Finally, Karl came out with the “really popular” Lego bag.</p><p>“I’m literally like, ‘This is the moment. He’s going to give me the bag,”Kim said, wrapping up her story.</p><p>“Then he goes over me and hands it to my mom.” She added that she ran to the bathroom and “started hysterically crying”.</p><p>She noted, “I'm like pregnant, hormonal, and flew all the way to Paris for this. I call my cousin CiCi and I’m like, ‘This b—ch took my f—king bag.’” Well, at least North will get it, right?</p><p>Kim was so upset because she planned to give the bag to North so that it could be displayed in her bedroom.
