The series has seen a number of familiar faces step in, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including McCaulay Culkin. </a>During Matt and Gaga's time together, the two had a number of intimate scenes together, and now, the actor is dishing out all the deets regarding his former co-star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Inside Look At The New American Horror Story Spin-Off</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-bomer-compliments-lady-gaga>Matt Bomer Compliments Lady Gaga</h2><p>When it comes to television shows, 'American Horror Story' has absolutely crushed it! The show first began back in 2011 and is now readying the release of its tenth season starring none other than McCaulay Culkin! Well, during the show's fourth season, fans saw the talented Matt Bomer step into the finale episode of 'Freakshow', prompting many to believe he would be joining for season 5. As fans suspected Matt would be joining the show permanently, it appears they were right! Bomer announced he would be joining 'American Horror Story: Hotel', however, he wouldn't be doing it alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga was also revealed to be appearing on the show, and the two would go on to have a number of steamy scenes together! Both actors said working together was extremely "comfortable", and when you put Matt and Gaga together, we would not expect anything less. Although Matt only remained on-board up until season 5, Gaga continued her role on 'American Horror Story: Roanoke'. Although both Matt and Gaga aren't part of the series any longer, Bomber has had nothing but great things to say about his time on the show and working with Gaga.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What The Cast Of American Horror Story Has To Say About The Show</a></span></p><p>Matt spoke with The Hollywood Reporter that when he discovered he'd be shotting with Lady Gaga,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he became incredibly "anxious".</a> Luckily for the star, Lady Gaga actually helped calm his nerves! The actor referred to Gaga as "relatable" and ensured that she "broke down the walls" for him and the rest of the cast. When asked about his opinion of Gaga, Matt said: "she's an icon. I couldn't help but have expectations of who she might be and she exceeded all of my unrealistically high expectations", Bomer said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor didn't stop there, he went on to say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaga "charmed everyone on set"</a> he told Andy Cohen on 'Watch What Happens Live!', proving what we already knew to be true, that Gaga is nothing short of a sweetheart! Although the two have not worked together since fans are waiting for their return to the big screen someday in the future, as are we!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>16 Terrifying True Events Behind 'American Horror Story'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKaZpKl6o7vMnqlmqpWWua3FjK2foqabqHqwsoylmJ2xXZyuqK2O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-about-sienna-weir-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>All About Sienna Weir | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
