After<a href=#> tying the knot in May 2018</a> at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, England, the queen gave them the additional title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>The couple welcomed their son, <a href=#>Archie</a>, the same month they celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary. The pair have been able to spend more time with their little one while quarantining amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“We were both there for his first steps, his first run, his first fall, his first everything,” Harry said during a conversation on International Day of the Girl in October 2020, while Meghan added, “I think it’s just fantastic, because I think in so many ways, we are fortunate to be able to have this time to watch him grow. And in the absence of COVID, we would be traveling and working more externally, and we’d miss a lot of those moments.

So everything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly important every single day. And that is not me being paranoid, that is just me not wanting a repeat of the past.”</p><p>Harry and Meghan announced <a href=#>their step back as senior members of the royal family</a> in January 2020 with plans to work to become financially independent. They left the British Army vet’s native U.K. for California in March 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>More than one year after their shocking exit, Buckingham Palace confirmed in February 2021 that the duo informed <a href=#><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong></a> that <a href=#>their decision to step down as working members of the royal family will be permanent</a>. “While we are all saddened by their decision, the duke and duchess remain much-loved members of the family,” the monarch’s statement read.</p><p>Scroll down to see a timeline of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s romance so far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecCnm2allZy1orqMppiro5yaeqK%2BxGacp5%2BRnLKlecBmq6KllaG2r7GMqJ1mrJiatrN50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pat-benatar-photos-singer-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of The Iconic 80s Rock Star Hollywood Life</span></a>
