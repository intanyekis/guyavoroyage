I think there’s probably one other one out there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “I think the other one was before we actually really sat down and talked like grown men about it. But yeah, that’s over and lol the beef never really escalated. It was just rap beef.” Their feud stemmed from the fact that LL claimed he was “the baddest rapper in the history of rap itself,” which Ice-T did not like.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That was the gist of it, absolutely,” Ice-T told AllHipHop. “Those things can always escalate because you have fans, and if they catch me out there, they’re gonna talk to me about LL. That can always escalate easily.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Thankfully the two legends were able to put their pride aside for the greater good and give Hip-Hop a deserving moment on the grand stage.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ice-T and LL Cool J were joined on stage by an all-star roster of artists spanning multiple decades, namely <a href=#>Grandmaster Flash</a> & The Furious Five, <a href=#>Black Thought</a> and The Roots, <a href=#>The LOX</a>, Queen Latifah, <a href=#>Missy Elliott</a>, Lil Baby, <a href=#>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and GloRilla.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX56wpnnTZquapJuoeqa6w6KloGWSmrKneculZJynn6F6q3mQa2ptb2Nphnp8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fala-chen.html><span>←</span><span>Fala Chen Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</span></a>
