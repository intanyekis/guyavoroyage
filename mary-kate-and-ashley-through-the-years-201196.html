They founded The Row in 2006 and Elizabeth and James in 2007, simultaneously retreating from the spotlight to gain more privacy.</p><p>The siblings <a href=#>rarely make public appearances or give interviews</a>, but they made an exception in 2018 when they opened up to WSJ. Magazine about their partnership.</p><p>“It’s been 32 years of learning how to communicate,” Ashley explained at the time, comparing their bond to “a marriage and a partnership. We have had ups and downs.”</p><p>While she added that the two “do everything together,” Mary-Kate chimed in, “We came out of the womb doing that.”</p><p>Ashley also revealed why the pair opt to let their work speak for itself. “We’re not product pushers,” she said. “I don’t know if it’s because of the way we grew up — we just don’t like talking about ourselves or talking about what we’re doing. … It’s not really our approach.”</p><p>Mary-Kate, for her part, tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Olivier Sarkozy</strong></a> in November 2015, allowing her to settle into a <a href=#>quiet personal life</a>. “I think we’re lucky. [Working hard] comes quite naturally for us. We don’t need so much time to sit and think and ponder,” she told Net-a-Porter’s The Edit of herself and Ashley in 2017. “But then <a href=#>I have a husband, two stepkids and a life</a>; I have to go home and cook dinner. I ride horses on the weekends. You find the thing that helps you relax, and if you don’t have it, you have to look for it. Or you get burned out, and then you’re not productive.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>News of the Beastly star’s <a href=#>split from the banker</a> broke in May 2020.
