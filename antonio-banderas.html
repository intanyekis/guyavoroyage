Also, they were also spotted vacationing in St.Tropez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/15/AntoNicole-1571133370504.jpg><p>The lovebirds attended the UK premiere screening of Banderas' critically successful movie, <i>Pain and Glory</i>. Further, it seems that the wedding has never been a top priority in their personal agenda. Also, the couple seems to be inseparable, and it’s evident they make the perfect match.</p><h2>First Marriage With Ana Leza</h2><p>Antonia Banderas has been married twice and his first wife was Spanish Actress, <strong>Ana Leza</strong>. They first met each other in Madrid through a common friend while attending the National Theatre.
