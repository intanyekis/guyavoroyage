There's nothing wrong with circulating air," he explained. However, there are a couple of side effects of sleeping with a fan on which could result in health issues.</p><p>When sleeping with a fan on, it tends to evaporate air from your mouth and nasal passage. This happens anytime air is circulated for an extended period. It's technically not a big deal, but it can just be a little annoying when you get up in the morning your mouth and nose is dry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have <a href=#>allergies</a>, the fan could heighten them as fans tend to blow dust all over — that is never good for allergy sufferers. Dr. Horovitz suggests placing your fan a reasonable distance away from your bed so it is circulating air but not blowing directly on you. By doing this, it will help minimize allergy flare-ups. Keeping an air filter in the bedroom on at all times will also help.</p><p>Sleeping with a fan on is not going to cause you to&nbsp;experience any severe health problems, but it is not without its issues. There are precautions you can take to minimize those issues, such as doing sinus irrigation each day and cleaning your bedroom regularly to keep the dust at bay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Getting a good <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep</a> is the most important thing for your health, so if having the fan on while you snooze achieves that goal then everything else can be managed. Plus, even if you sleep with the air conditioner on, there are going to be health issues, such as cold air causing stiffness in your muscles.</p><p>After reading this, you prefer to sleep with a fan on, the air conditioning on or both?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmirnJqysXnFmqVmmpGZeqmxwKWroWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarface-mike-dean-tiny-desk-performance-1234834922.html><span>←</span><span>Scarface Taps Mike Dean For Riveting 'Tiny Desk' Performance</span></a>
