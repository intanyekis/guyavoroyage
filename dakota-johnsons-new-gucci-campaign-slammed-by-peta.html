What’s caused controversy, however, is that several of the Gucci handbags are made with authentic reptile skin, including python and crocodile.</p><p>The campaign caught the attention of PETA, who sent a letter to Dakota’s team expressing their disapproval.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m writing regarding your ambassadorship with Gucci,” the typed letter begins. “According to the company’s website, you’ve been modeling real python and crocodile skins. The exotic skins industry is extremely cruel.”</p><p>“PETA Asia recently investigated an Indonesian slaughterhouse that supplies skins to Gucci, and the findings were horrific,” it continues.</p><p>The letter adds, “Gucci’s use of exotic skins and your promotion of its products are extremely damaging. Please, may we hear from you today that you’ll pledge to stop?”</p><p>PETA also pointed out that Dakota’s collaboration with Gucci seems out of character, given the controversy surrounding the brand and the actress’s penchant for supporting human rights causes, including BLM.</p><p>So far, Dakota hasn’t addressed the controversy surrounding the Gucci campaign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thee 50 Shades of Grey actress is hardly the first celebrity to be called out by PETA.

However, the sweet moment was shortly lived, since PETA issued a statement soon after.</p><p>"<a href=#>PETA is calling on the couple to Level Up</a> on kindness by adopting a companion for this pup instead of fueling the homeless-animal crisis,” the organization stated.</p><p>They also claimed Ciara made a "One, Two Step mistake by killing a shelter dog's chances of finding a home."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Lawsuit May Stop Donald Trump’s 2024 Presidential Campaign</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TheThings</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxorfOrZhmop%2Bdu7S7zaxkp52nYrS2r8KiZJyZnaWuqrPNZqqlmZ2isqV5wbJkqZ2klnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./babyname.html><span>←</span><span>Roman - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</span></a>
