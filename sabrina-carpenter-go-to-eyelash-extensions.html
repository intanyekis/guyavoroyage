They’re made with a thin, non-irritating band, which is a plus for beauty enthusiasts with sensitive eyes. Each set comes equipped with 10mm 12mm and 14mm lash clusters designed to provide up to three weeks of wear. You can mix and match your lash length to achieve the perfect style. The Velour Multi-Day Lash Bond helps these water-resistant lash extensions last up to five days.</p><p>The application is simple. Apply the Multi-Day Lash Bond across the top of one lash cluster and underneath the natural lash. Wait between 10-to-15 minutes until it gets tacky, and use the Too Real Lash Extension Tool to place the cluster on the underside of your natural lashes, just above the water line. You can use the extension tool to fuse the falsies with your natural lashes to provide additional security.</p><p>For a flared shape, apply lash clusters in increasing length from the outer corner using the longest cluster and decreasing in size as you work toward the inner eye. For a round shape, apply the same-length lash clusters from the outer corner inward.</p><p>Celebrities aren’t the only ones who swear by these lashes.

I feel like I’m doing my part to help the environment by using reusable products.”</p><p>A lash newbie opened up about their journey using the lashes. “I definitely need some more practice but first impressions are everything,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the shopper</a> began. They were “Super impressed with how lightweight these lashes are.” The reviewer said, “I like that they come in clusters so I can control how much or little I want to add to my lids.”</p><p>Ready to elevate your makeup moments?
