According to a statement made by her publicist on behalf of her family, Somers died peacefully in the early hours of October 15.</p><p class=Fg>She was surrounded by her loved ones and spent her last moments in her dream home. Somers was well-known and revered for her illustrious career, which included lighting up her fans' television screens in the ever-popular late 70s classic "Three's Company." She was adored by many who followed her incredible profession and those who had the pleasure of knowing her personally.</p><p class=Fg>One of the people who loved her dearly and stuck by her side throughout her life was her devoted and doting husband, Alan Hamel, who stayed with her every step of the way when her breast cancer returned and when she was on her deathbed. The couple shared a beautiful romantic timeline of 55 years before the "Step by Step" star died.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>1969: It All Started on the Set of a Game Show</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>The year was 1969; <a class="Xd a" href=#>Somers</a> was working as one of the prize models for the game show "The Anniversary Game," while Hamel was the host.
