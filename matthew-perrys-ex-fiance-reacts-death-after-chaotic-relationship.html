Days after his death, his former partner has spoken out to reflect on the beloved actor and the legacy he leaves behind.</p><p>Molly Hurwitz, 32, took to Instagram on Monday to write a touching tribute to her ex. “He would love that the world is talking about how talented he was. And he really was very talented,” she began the post.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-rsquo-s-ex-fianc-eacute-says-he-hurt-her-deeply>Matthew Perry’s Ex-Fiancé Says He Hurt Her Deeply</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Molly reflected on some of their favorite memories, including watching reruns of Friends. “As the Friends reunion was approaching, we rewatched the show together. ‘F**k, I was so good!!!…See what I did there???’ We rewound and studied scenes,” she continued. “Our respect and appreciation of humor is something that connected us. Being with him as he rediscovered his brilliance was magical.”</p><p>Molly included an image of Matthew with his back turned to the camera, overlooking a wintery wonderland cityscape. While she declined to provide context over why their relationship ended years prior to Matthew’s passing, Molly did reflect on the actor’s troubled history, a seeming reference to his drug and alcohol addiction, something the actor was vocal about during his lifetime.</p><p>“But, I obviously knew that man in a very different way, too. While I loved him deeper than I could comprehend, he was complicated, and he caused pain like I’d never known,” she wrote. “No one in my adult life has had a more profound impact on me than Matthew Langford Perry. I have tremendous gratitude for that, for everything I learned from our relationship.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She ended her post by mentioning Al-Anon, an international organization that provides support to people who’ve been impacted by a loved one’s alcoholism. Matthew and Molly were first romantically connected in 2018, before getting engaged in 2020. However, they called off their engagement the following year.</p><p>“I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Al Anon, an invaluable resource for those who love someone struggling with this destructive disease,” Molly continued. “Matty, I feel relief that you are at peace.”</p><h2 id=matthew-rsquo-s-death-is-still-being-investigated>Matthew’s Death Is Still Being Investigated</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar47842196.jpg><p>It's been confirmed that Matthew died of <a href=#>cardiac arrest after he was found by his assistant</a> unresponsive in a jacuzzi in his Pacific Palisades home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Police have verified that although there were no illicit drugs discovered on the property, numerous prescription medications were located.
