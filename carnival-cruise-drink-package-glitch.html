The error led to the incorrect display of discounted prices, prompting guests to try to take advantage of the perceived bargain. However, Carnival Cruise Line confirmed that the originally displayed prices would not be honored. Nevertheless, the company is offering a discount to guests affected by the glitch.</p><p>The erroneous calculation did not reflect the actual cost of the package at checkout, resulting in guests appearing to receive substantial discounts, and suggesting that the package might not be required for each guest in a stateroom. Carnival Cruise Line’s brand ambassador, John Heald, addressed the situation, announcing that guests who attempted to purchase the package at the mistaken price would receive a refund and a one-time discount code for a future repurchase. Impacted guests will receive their discount codes via email in the coming days.</p><p>The specifics of the discount have not been disclosed, leaving open the possibility of various offers, such as a percentage off, an extra day of the package, a two-for-one deal, or other forms of discounts. However, a substantial “buy-one-day-get-the-rest-of-the-cruise-free” offer is unlikely.</p><p>Heald also shared this information on his <span style=color:#00f><a style=color:#00f href=#>Facebook</a></span> page, and Carnival’s website states that the Cheers! package starts at $59.95 per person per day and is available to individuals aged 21 and above. It includes a wide range of drinks such as spirits, cocktails, beer, and wine, as well as sodas, specialty coffee, hot tea, and 500ml bottled water. According to AAA, in 2022, 58.3 million Americans considered going on a cruise within the next two years, with a strong uptick in bookings approaching pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>AAA Vice President Paula Twidale emphasized the unique aspects of cruising, highlighting the journey and onboard experiences that appeal to all age groups. Heald also acknowledged the website issues and assured customers of efforts being made to resolve the problems. He apologized for the inconvenience caused by the website’s temporary unavailability.</p><p>The video below talks about it more:</p><p></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiamqqensOiuIycqa6ho5p6pb7Ip6JmqJGYuKKzxGaepaGkmLVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./296345-blake-shelton-quits-the-voice-be-3-steps-html.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Shelton Quits 'The Voice' to Be with 3 Stepsons His Dad Showed Him How to Be Devoted Paren</span></a>
