The status is they’re cranking away and getting season two ready. I think obviously, with all the happenings in the industry and strike stuff, schedules get a little jumbled and stuff,” Joe explained. “But I know that they’re going full speed. We’re in pre-production, and hopefully, we’ll be in production soon.”</p><p>Check out our full interview with Samoa Joe below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-nation-of-violence>Nation of Violence</h2><p>Samoa Joe spoke with WrestleZone while promoting season one of Twisted Metal. He was asked by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestleZone Managing Editor Bill Pritchard</a> how his Nation of Violence character would have fared in&nbsp;the TV show universe.</p><p>“He’d do absolutely fantastic,” Samoa Joe said. “I think he’d definitely get the assignment right. He’d find himself a fantastic vehicle and wreak carnage everywhere that he went. I mean, it’s in the name, and I think it’d work out really well.”</p><p>When asked what happened to the ninjas who kidnapped him in TNA, Joe subtly teased that he vanquished them all.</p><p>“So they were all disposed of quite a long time ago,” Samoa Joe revealed. “I don’t really know what has become of them, but it would be interesting to see how they would do. We haven’t seen them since, have you? But you’ve seen me. I think we all know what happened. We don’t talk about it much because, obviously, you just don’t talk about things like that, but the ninjas were dispatched and taken care of.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ2xxaWLAornOmmSjp5VitbC8xJ%2BspWWkpHq0wMCrq2aooqSxtq%2FToqanZZ%2BjerXDyKyrnpxdorK1rctmqp6Zo6S7bn6MrKaopg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./octomom-nadya-suleman-reveals-son-aidan-is-severely-autistic.html><span>←</span><span>Octomom Nadya Suleman Reveals Son Aidan Is Severely Autistic</span></a>
