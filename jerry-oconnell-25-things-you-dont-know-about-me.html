1. I love public transportation. I guess because I’m from NYC.
2. I was born and raised in NYC’s Chelsea. Wallace Shawn lived across the street. To this day, I get starstruck when I see him.
3. I met my wife [Rebecca Romijn, 45] and immediately fell for her."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Read on to learn 25 things about the star.</p><p>1. I love public transportation. I guess because I’m from NYC.</p><p>2. I was born and raised in NYC’s Chelsea. <strong>Wallace Shawn</strong> lived across the street. To this day, I get starstruck when I see him.</p><p>3. I met my wife [<strong>Rebecca Romijn</strong>, 45] and immediately fell for her. We have a relationship based on laughter. That girl makes me laugh.</p><p>4. We have twin girls, Dolly and Charlie, 9. I was in shock when I found out we were having twins. Not sure if I have ever recovered.</p><p>5. Two summers ago, our air conditioner broke and I took my kids to the beach every day and taught them to surf.</p><p>6. I went to NYU’s film school for college, where I would often see Professor <strong>Spike Lee</strong> walking the halls.</p><p>7. I fenced all through college and was captain of the sabre squad. Nationally, I was ranked 17th at my peak.</p><p>8. I’ve been told I snore but still don’t believe it.</p><p>9. Charlie is named after my brother [<strong>Charlie O’Connell</strong>, 43]. For some insane reason, she is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. No one in our family is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jerry-oconnell-Rebecca-Romijn.jpg><p>10. Dolly is named after <strong>Dolly Parton</strong>. Rebecca went to her show when she was pregnant and Dolly dedicated the song “Little Sparrow” to my wife and her “little sparrows.”</p><p>11. I am a law school dropout! I might go back, so lay off me…</p><p>12. I still get nervous at auditions.</p><p>13. I only use spray deodorant.</p><p>14. I can’t grow a beard. Definitely missing out on this beard thing these days.</p><p>15. I was the first of any of my family to move to California. I had a tan year ’round.</p><p>16. I am not <strong>Jason Bateman</strong>.</p><p>17. My grandfather Charles Witkowski was mayor of Jersey City from 1956 to 1960. It is a real point of pride in our family.</p><p>18. My father emigrated from England to NYC in the 1950s. When Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery came out [in 1997], my brother and I thought for sure that was our dad when he was younger.</p><p>19. I have both a U.S. and British passport. I can do a near-perfect London accent.</p><p>20. Rebecca and I have three large dogs. We love them so much.</p><p>21. I was never a cat person until my wife adopted two. Now I love them and they sleep on my head every night.</p><p>22. Rebecca and I go on solo dates to karaoke. We like to sing duets.</p><p>23. We are huge yacht rock fans. We saw <strong>Christopher Cross</strong>, <strong>Michael McDonald</strong> and <strong>Kenny Loggins</strong> in concert and had the best time. It was our anniversary!</p><p>24. My wife and I watch Bravo every night. When we meet any of the Real Housewives, we freak out.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I own a towel with an image of Rebecca in a bikini. It may be my most prized possession.</p><p>Play by Play premieres on Sunday, September 24, on Bravo at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeqqKuerCvzqelnqScYn92edOhoKefo2LGsMGMnaanrF2gu7DDjJqZqK2kYrqmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-owen-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Owen Net Worth How Much is Owen Worth?</span></a>
