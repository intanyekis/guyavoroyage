He is approximately 74 years old. He holds American nationality and is known for his career as a former basketball player and Olympic gold medalist.</p><p>Known for his exceptional talent, Haywood began his career at a young age and demonstrated an early interest in sports, excelling in basketball during his time at Pershing High School, and later, Trinidad State Junior College.

Notably, he was appointed #30 overall by the Buffalo Braves in the 1971 NBA draft, won an NBA championship in 1980, and was honored as the most valuable player in the American Basketball Association in 1970, among other achievements.</p><p>Moreover, Haywood’s impact on the game extended beyond his playing career, as he was integral in paving the way for underclassmen college basketball players to leave college early and play professionally—an initiative known as the “Spencer Haywood rule.”</p><p><strong>Spencer Haywood Personal Life</strong></p><p>Haywood was married to fashion model Iman from 1977 to 1987 and has a daughter named Zulekha Haywood.
