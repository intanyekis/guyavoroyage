Holloway Doesn’t Make It Home</strong></h2><p>Natalee Holloway did as teenagers do. She and her friends from Alabama’s Mountain Brook High School celebrated their graduation on stunning beaches and partied in Caribbean nightclubs.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the presence of seven teacher chaperones, the former students were left to their own devices, told to enjoy themselves before setting off to college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/What-Happened-to-Natalee-Holloway-683x1024.jpg><p>The morning of her flight back home on May 30, Holloway never made it out of Aruba.&nbsp;</p><p>With her suitcase packed and passport ready to be grabbed on her way out the door of her room at Aruba’s Holiday Inn, it appears as though she was prepared to go back to reality.</p><p>The night before, Holloway and her friends were enjoying themselves at the popular Carlos ‘n Charlie’s bar in Oranjestad, where she bumped into Dutch national Joran van der Sloot.&nbsp;</p><p>After a couple of hours of dancing and drinking, Holloway was spotted leaving the bar with van der Sloot and his friends, Satish and Deepak Kaploe, around 1 am.&nbsp;</p><p>When friends were unable to locate Holloway the morning of her flight, chaperones alerted her mother, Beth Holloway Twitty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Beginning Of The Investigation</strong></h2><p>Twitty, who flew to Aruba with Holloway’s stepfather, chose to open an informal investigation on her own.&nbsp;</p><p>The Twittys began by questioning staff at the Holiday Inn, leading them to the very bar their daughter met van der Sloot.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, they went to his home in Noord to get the answers they deserved.</p><p>Van der Sloot was adamant he and the Kalpoe brothers took Holloway to see a lighthouse just before dropping her off at the hotel around 2 am.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed she was helped inside by a security guard but was unable to find whoever it was.&nbsp;</p><p>Since it had yet to be 48 hours since Holloway was missing, a group of around 100 tourists and locals assisted the Twittys in locating their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Once local authorities took over, they were aided by a Texan volunteer team, Dutch Marines, and three F-16 planes sent from the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite their intense search over the next few weeks, their rescue efforts seemed fruitless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Aruban Police Make First Arrests</strong></h2><p>Ten days after Holloway vanished, local police finally took Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers into custody, urged by Holloway’s family and community uproar.&nbsp;</p><p>The suspects’ <a href=#>stories</a> then began to contradict one another, with the brothers saying they dropped Holloway and van der Sloot off at a beach near the hotel before driving away and van der Sloot claiming he left her to walk back on her own.</p><p>After constant cross-examination by the boys’ attorneys and the prosecution, van der Sloot was kept in police custody for another 60 days while the brothers were released, as per the Judge’s orders.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Investigation HIts Multiple Dead Ends, Suspects Set Free</strong></h2><p>Following months of potential DNA matches and tips from locals – including a gardener who alleged that the body had been dumped into a pond and a jogger claiming to see the suspects burying a body – investigators chose to abandon the case on July 30.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2005, all three suspects were released on the condition they remain available for any further questioning.</p><p>Over the next few years, Holloway’s family and van der Sloot engaged in a media back-and-forth, with van der Sloot appearing in interviews and releasing books addressing the case and the Holloways dismissing his claims on national news.</p><p>With new incriminating evidence making the rounds time and time again, the suspects spent the next couple of years in and out of prison.&nbsp;</p><p>Van der Sloot made headlines in 2010 after being convicted of the murder of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez in his own hotel in Lima, Peru.&nbsp;</p><p>Tragically, her body was not discovered immediately as he had left instructions to hotel staff to stay away from the room.&nbsp;</p><p>He confessed to the murder two years later. His legal team believed he had endured long-term psychological trauma from being the prime suspect in the Holloway case, making his murder of Flores a snap judgment. This has been contested by prosecutors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Holloway Declared Legally Dead</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;At her father’s insistence, although against her mother’s wishes, an Alabama judge declared Natalee Holloway legally dead. According to Twitty’s attorney:</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>“Beth’s position is that she has no proof or indication that Holloway is still alive, but absent any proof or indication that she is dead, she always wants to hang onto that slight glimmer of hope.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Destined To Remain A Cold Case?</strong></h2><p>Although it appears Aruban and Dutch authorities have given up their search, Holloway’s family and thousands of true crime enthusiasts online are hopeful that Natalee will get the justice she deserves.</p><p>&nbsp;Be it remains or a first-hand account of her death, her parents have been demanding answers since the day of her disappearance, and the world is hopeful they will soon get closure.</p><p>&nbsp;Since the extensive coverage Holloway’s case received in the early to mid-2000s, hundreds of other missing persons cases have been making the rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Various Internet sleuths and self-proclaimed investigators have brought older cold cases to light in an attempt to either solve these themselves or to encourage authorities to pick them up once again.</p><p>&nbsp;As harrowing as many of these cases are, it is important to note that it seems as though missing people of colour continue to be sidelined amongst the hundreds of cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, bringing attention to such people will lead to even more buzz around their respective disappearances. With multiple docu-series and documentaries being released on streaming platforms, it’s likely we’ll hear more over time.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwyKyYqaiVlr%2BiusKeZKieXaOuta3LnpxmoJ%2BhubDDwLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nile-niamis-wealth-unveiled-a-journey-from-film-producer-to-real-estate-magnate.html><span>←</span><span>Nile Niami Net Worth</span></a>
