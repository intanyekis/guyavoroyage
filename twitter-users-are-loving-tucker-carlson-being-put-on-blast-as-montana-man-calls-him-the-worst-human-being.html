Montana is more conservative than liberal, but that doesn't mean there aren't any left leaning citizens that reside in the mountainous state. Bailey would later post his confrontation with the&nbsp;political commentator on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since this viral video came out, many Twitter users&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;the Fox News representative being roasted in a state where he least expected it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B Remains Unphased As Fox News Blames Her For 'Weakening American Society'</a></span></p><p>Bailey wrote on Instagram, "It’s not everyday you get to tell someone they are the worst person in the world and really mean it! What an a**hole! This man has killed more people with vaccine misinformation, he has supported extreme racism, he is a fascist and does more to rip this country apart than anyone that calls themselves an American."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When confronted by Bailey, Carlson whispered to the store owner to keep it down, saying, "Settle down, son." Bailey was not having it, and told him not to call him that as the video ends seconds later.</p><p>Other than Carlson, there have been other controversial commentators from Fox News, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megyn Kelly</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomi Lahren</a>&nbsp;who have also been criticized for their less than ideal takes on political and social issues.</p><p>There have been debates on Twitter whether it was necessary to do something like this, even if it seems warranted for bringing criticism to the&nbsp;Tucker Carlson Tonight host. The majority of Twitter, however, is on board with seeing Carlson get ratted out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Is Convinced Fox News 'Voter Fraud Whistleblower' Is In Fact Donald Trump</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Users such as @hornfels called the whole incident "based," praising Bailey for standing his own ground and not showing cowardice whatsoever. Another user, @guido_father, believes that confronting celebrities like him should be the norm due to the misinformation Carlson brought regarding the pandemic and his alleged racism as mentioned by Bailey.</p><p>Others like @shlliep64 have been calling Bailey a national treasure for his bravery and giving them entertainment as they replayed the clip many times. Some even noted that Carlson looked afraid and knew that he was being called out, despite his attempts to mediate the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This won't be the first time a conservative political commentator will get called out and caught on video, and it definitely won't be the last.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Slams Rose McGowan For Speaking About Britney Spears On Tucker Carlson</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirsKGkqbKzedSsnKurXZa%2FpnnLqK2ippdiwbavyp6pZpuRp7m0u81mmZ6hnpx6scHTZqanZZKhrrTAjJqqZqWfo8GiusBmpJqmXZiurbjSZp%2BipV2ptaZ51qiprKxdncKurc1mmZ6hnpx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richest-yoruba-actors-and-actresses.html><span>←</span><span>Top 20 Richest Yoruba Actors and Actresses in Nigeria [2024]</span></a>
