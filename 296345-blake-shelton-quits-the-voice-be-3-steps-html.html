His post was met with good wishes from fans and colleagues.</p><p class=Xg>Shelton loved being on "The Voice," but when it comes to his family, he is passionate and committed. He does not have any children of his own but has three stepsons who have drastically changed his life.</p><p><h2 class=ah><strong class=Vg>Shelton Got an Instant Family</strong></h2></p><p class=Xg>Gwen Stefani and Shelton judged "The Voice" together for some time before they explored a romantic relationship. They knew they would be together for a long time when they got together and eventually got engaged in October 2020.</p><p class=Xg>They then <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-married-oklahoma-wedding/>married</a> in July 2021, and Stefani's sons played a massive role in the couple's wedding. A source revealed that the three boys were excited that their mother was marrying Shelton and were eager to be a part of the wedding.</p><p class=Xg>Stefani welcomed her sons, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo, with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. When talking about how it felt to have stepchildren, Shelton <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-talks-family-life-with-gwen-stefani/>said</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"I've married into a family."</p><p class=Xg>Shelton admitted that Stefani was skeptical about whether or not he could be a stepdad to her children and whether their relationship would last because she had children from a previous marriage, but Shelton proved her fears invalid.</p><p class=Xg>The country star has mentioned on many occasions that he is enamored with his stepsons and loves to teach them new skills like fishing and starting fires on his ranch. Stefani's sons love Shelton as much as he loves them.</p><p class=Xg>Stefani and Shelton began dating in 2015, and her sons quickly <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/23/gwen-stefani-kids-blake-shelton-father-figure-parenting-role-gavin/>accepted</a> him as a father figure.

He also mentioned that he was enjoying releasing singles but not being tied to albums.</p><p><h2 class=ah><strong class=Vg>Shelton Was Inspired by His Father</strong></h2></p><p class=Xg>Welcoming Stefani's children into his life was something that Shelton did not have to think twice about because of the example his father, Dick Shelton, set for him many years ago. Shelton's father married his mother even though she already had a son, Shelton's older brother, Richie.</p><p class=Xg>Shelton said that because his father raised his brother without a second thought when it came to him raising Stefani's three sons, he was eager to do it and knew that he would be an excellent stepfather to the boys.</p><p class=Xg>Talking about how it felt for him to have three sons that were not biologically linked to him, Shelton confirmed it made no difference to him.

Dick's health had been declining for a year before his death, and he was in the hospital with pneumonia soon before he passed away.</p><p class=Xg>The country star mentioned that he also had a stepfather in his life, who had inspired him to be the stepfather he is today. He admitted that having a stepdad taught him to be a great stepdad to his stepchildren.</p><p class=Xg>He said that he took the job seriously but also ensured that he had fun with his stepsons and <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.audacy.com/kfrog/latest/blake-shelton-loves-that-hes-going-to-be-a-stepdad>admitted</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"I can't imagine my life without these kids now."</p><p class=Xg>He has often shared photos of his stepchildren on social media, saying how much he loves them and how proud he is of them.
