There is another magical moment, though: when you bring your children home. It is perhaps the most beautiful moment.”</p><p>Two months later, Us confirmed that Jenner had moved on with <a href=#><strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong></a>. The duo, who have been spotted spending time together, <a href=#>have not yet publicly addressed their relationship</a> status.</p><p>The Hulu personality, however, recently <a href=#>offered a glimpse into her positive outlook on life.</a></p><p>“It’s really such a blessing that I’ve been able to live and experience so much life at such a young age. I have two kids, I’m 25. Honestly, I’ve never been happier,” she told HommeGirls in April. “As I get older, I get more appreciative of my life, my family, my friends and having all these opportunities.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenner also hinted that she <a href=#>wasn’t against the idea of having more kids</a>, adding, “I don’t have a number in my mind. Some women do, but I don’t really have a plan. I think that whatever happens is meant to happen. I believe things are written for us. Whatever is gonna happen, it’s gonna happen. But I also feel very in control of my life and my decisions.”</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Jones</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm62xKelnqpdqb%2BiwsisZKybn6nBbq3RnmSfoZ6Wua3FjJ2mp51dm7yzecaopp1lkZvBpr6MrKeloaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-why-matilda-star-mara-wilson-retired-from-acting.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Why 'Matilda' Star Mara Wilson Retired From Acting</span></a>
