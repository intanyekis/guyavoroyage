Luton took the lead when <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9YdmlCJetQdjaa00 href=#>Elijah Adebayo</a> rose high at the back post to head past Ederson just before the half-time break. It capped off a difficult first half for City.</p><p>But they responded well after the break. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ggVYkgD9dgp7Qo28 href=#>Bernardo Silva</a> curled the ball home in the 62nd minute to level the scores before <a class=ath_autolink data-id=D9VhhPVj6LYzpmVZ href=#>Jack Grealish</a> slid in at the far post to win the game for City.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Here, Sam Lee analyses the match.</p><h2><b>How did City cope without Haaland?</b></h2><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=UqdITFAwdmIrBQfd href=#>Erling Haaland</a>’s absence due to injury meant that almost no matter what happened, the match would have been looked at through a big Norwegian-shaped lens. And because City won, the takeaway is simple: no Haaland, no problem.</p><p>No doubt, had they not won, it would have been seen differently. But Haaland’s absence, even in future games, need not be a major issue for City. Guardiola said: “Stress bone. Stress. Just stress. Please don’t ask that his foot is broken. It’s just stress bone. He was not ready for this game, I don’t think he will be ready for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=676 href=#>Crystal Palace</a>. Hopefully, he can be ready for Saudi Arabia. Week-by-week will dictate how he feels.”</p><p>If that is to be the case, City do not have to panic. The story of last season, in a tactical sense, was Guardiola spending months trying to ensure City can play with the same balance of their XI and control of matches with the big striker. They had previously played with a false nine who could link up with the midfield better and help City outnumber their opponents in the final third.</p><p>City found a solution to that eventually (<a class=ath_autolink data-id=Qco6BKmHmB44RMjL href=#>John Stones</a> stepping into midfield) but another option would have been not playing Haaland. That was never going to happen by choice, of course, but now there is no alternative.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=s7XcWPajmHg12zuq href=#>Julian Alvarez</a> is not seen as a top-level false nine by Guardiola but there was a little bit more fluidity to their play at Kenilworth Road, in the first half at least. Haaland’s absence is likely to be a trade-off: better link-ups around the box but, perhaps, less precision inside.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/10105508/GettyImages-1837620346-1024x683.jpg alt width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Alvarez started as a striker in Haaland’s abscence (Nick Potts/PA Images via Getty Images)</span><p>It’s worth remembering City won two league titles with the former.</p><h2><b>City show strength of mind to come from behind</b></h2><p>City had played perfectly well in the first half; they kept Luton well away from their box for 46 minutes 50 seconds, maintained possession and created some decent chances. Given their recent run of four games without a victory in the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6 href=#>Premier League</a>, it was important that they stuck to their game plan in the second half and pushed for what they felt they would have deserved.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>After Luton’s sucker punch on the verge of half-time — it showcased City’s slight weaknesses: <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Q36YxjElleCmJU6X href=#>Josko Gvardiol</a> giving up easy possession, the midfield not being able to win it back and the defence not being able to deal with the cross — they had to make sure they did not feel sorry for themselves.</p><p>And they didn’t. Although <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ZTVFCfiA5I3chgf href=#>Kyle Walker</a> came out onto the pitch still debating the foul throw laws with referee Tim Robinson, who signalled in return that both hands had to be behind the head at release but seemingly did not apply that to Bernardo Silva’s first-half effort, City quickly forgot about the opening 45 minutes and put things right.</p><p>Two quick-fire goals got them out of their predicament, although they hardly recaptured the control they had shown up until that point for the 30 minutes after. Luton did not make the most of it, but City will certainly want to improve on their game management going forward.</p><p>Still, Guardiola wanted to “change the dynamic” of their results, and they have done it with an overall impressive display.</p><h2><b>Why was City’s bench so limited?</b></h2><p>There was a point earlier this season — when Guardiola was bemoaning the number of fixtures in the football calendar and the small gap between seasons — when the City manager was asked whether he would ever reconsider his preference for a small squad. The answer was no. “I prefer not to be a manager,” he said.</p><p>Guardiola prefers to have 14 or 15 top players, most of whom can play in several different positions so that when everybody is fit, he does not have to leave out stars. This has been a key part of City’s success over the years and he will seemingly never change it.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/10102641/GettyImages-1837591377-1024x682.jpg alt width=1024 height=682 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Guardiola prefers a small squad (Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images)</span><p>Not that it has made many people outside of the City bubble take notice. It is still common to hear how they have the biggest squad in the league, even capable of fielding a second team that could win the title.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>On Sunday, yet again, they named two goalkeepers on the bench. Usually this season, they have had eight subs rather than the maximum nine.</p><p>For those who think City’s reserves could win the league with their eyes closed, it may have been a surprise to see their bench on Sunday, which had very few attacking options on it. That is pretty much how it has been all season after just two, three or four injuries — and Guardiola would not change it.</p><h2><b>What did Guardiola say?</b></h2><p><span>Speaking about Haaland’s injury, Guardiola said: “We don’t know. It’s his foot, we’ll see. Day by day, week by week. Hopefully, we can recover him for the [Club] World Cup.”</span></p><p>He added: “(It was a) great performance after what happened in the last results. We conceded the goal in the last minute of the first half. It was a really good test and the players reacted as they had to.</p><p>“That is the challenge. They are still there in the way that they run, they fight and here and behave how we behave. I am really proud.”</p><h2>What next for Manchester City?</h2><p><strong>Wednesday, December 13</strong>: Red Star Belgrade (A), <a class=ath_autolink data-id=7 href=#>Champions League</a>, 5.45pm GMT, 12.45pm ET</p><p>City go into their final game of the group stage knowing they will finish top of Group G, no matter the result. Red Star, who will finish bottom, were beaten 3-1 at the Etihad in September.</p><h2>Recommended reading</h2><p>(Top photo: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images))</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGpoamphaHxzfJFsZmpqX2Z9cLjUraanZZ2Wu6S0xKyrnqpdmLa1xYyrnKmnoql6orrApbCsoaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./logics-wife-brittney-noell-gives-birth-to-second-baby.html><span>←</span><span>Logic and wife Brittney Noell welcome their second baby: We couldnt be happier</span></a>
