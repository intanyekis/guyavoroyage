Vexcalibur Quest Guide And Hidden Chest Locations</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2 id=destiny_2 class=smooth-goto>Destiny 2</h2><p>Destiny 2 is a popular online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was initially released as a pay-to-play game in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. The game became free-to-play under the title “New Light” on October 1, 2019, which was aimed at attracting new players to the game. This transition to free-to-play was a significant change in the game’s business model, as it allowed players to enjoy the core content of the game without having to pay for it.</p><p>Destiny 2 is a games-as-a-service model, which means that it is continually updated with new content and features over time. This model has been successful in keeping players engaged and interested in the game over the years. The game’s story takes place in a fictional universe where players take on the role of a Guardian, a protector of Earth’s last city. The game features various game modes, including a campaign mode, player versus player mode, and player versus environment mode.</p><h2 id=how_to_get_vexcalibur_exotic_glaive_in_destiny_2 class=smooth-goto>How to get vexcalibur exotic glaive in Destiny 2?</h2><p>To obtain the Vex Mythoclast Exotic Glaive in Destiny 2, you need to complete the “Presage” mission on Master difficulty, which is available through the Season of the Chosen content. Here are the steps to obtain the weapon:</p><ul readability=7><li readability=-1><p>Complete the “Presage” mission on any difficulty to unlock Master difficulty.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Reach a Power level of at least 1325 before attempting the Master difficulty version of the mission.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Assemble a fireteam and enter the Master difficulty version of the “Presage” mission.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Progress through the mission until you reach the final boss, and defeat it.</p></li><li readability=1><p>After defeating the final boss, open the hidden chest in the boss room to obtain the Catalyst for the Vex Mythoclast.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Return to orbit and complete the Catalyst by killing enemies with the weapon in PvE activities.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Once the Catalyst is complete, return to the “Presage” mission on Master difficulty and defeat the final boss again to obtain the Vex Mythoclast.</p></li></ul><p>Note that the Vex Mythoclast is not guaranteed to drop on your first completion of the Master difficulty version of the “Presage” mission. It may take multiple attempts before the weapon drops.</p><h2 id=vexcalibur_quest_guide_and_hidden_chest_locations_in_destiny_2 class=smooth-goto>Vexcalibur quest guide and hidden chest locations in Destiny 2</h2><p>There are many exotic weapons and quests in Destiny 2, each with their unique set of requirements and steps to obtain. One of the most popular exotic weapons in Destiny 2 is the “Gjallarhorn,” which has recently made a return to the game. To obtain the Gjallarhorn, players need to complete a series of quests and steps, including obtaining various items and completing challenging missions.</p><p>Aside from exotic quests, hidden chests can be found throughout various activities in Destiny 2. Some of the most common activities with hidden chests are raids and dungeons. For example, in the Last Wish raid, there are multiple hidden chests that can be found by exploring the raid and completing certain requirements. Additionally, in the Pit of Heresy dungeon, there is a hidden chest that can be found by completing a jumping puzzle and a series of platforming challenges.</p><p>To locate hidden chests, players must explore and experiment with the activities they are completing. Hidden chests often require a certain set of conditions to be met, such as defeating a specific enemy or completing a certain objective. Players should keep an eye out for any unusual or hidden paths, as these can often lead to the location of a hidden chest.</p><p>In summary, while there is no exotic weapon or item named “Vexcalibur” in Destiny 2, there are many exotic weapons and quests, as well as hidden chests, that players can discover and obtain by exploring and completing various activities in the game.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
