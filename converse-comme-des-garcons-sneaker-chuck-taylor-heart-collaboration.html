Chuck Taylors have been in style since the ‘70s, and we’re pretty sure they’re not going out of style any time soon, nor would we want them to. They’re a true everyday staple sneaker, and we always make sure to have one pair in our closet, minimum. So when Converse collaborates with Comme des Garcons, we’re on the release like a cat hearing the sound of treats in a bag."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They’re a true everyday staple sneaker, and we always make sure to have one pair in our closet, minimum. So when Converse collaborates with Comme des Garcons, we’re on the release like a cat hearing the sound of treats in a bag. This shoe certainly is a treat for us!</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Comme des Garcons Play Chuck Taylor Hidden Heart Low Top Sneaker</a> is “an outfit enhancer,” as one excited shopper put it. It’s the classic look of a low-top, canvas Chuck Taylor with the adorable detail of Comme des Garcons’ iconic heart-and-eyes motif peeking halfway out from the sole. Shoppers can’t stop receiving compliments when they wear these <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> out, one mentioning how they’ve been “walking around with a cloud of compliments trailing in [their] wake.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Converse-Comme-des-Garcons-Sneaker-Black.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Comme des Garcons Play Chuck Taylor Hidden Heart Low Top Sneaker</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$135</a> at Nordstrom! Also available for <a href=# rel=noopener>$135</a> from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ssense</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>$135</a> from <a href=# rel=noopener>Barneys</a>.</strong></p><p>These cute and quirky Chucks are the brainchild of New York graphic artist Filip Pagowski and Comme des Garcons’ Rei Kawakubo, and wow, do they make a good team! These sneakers feature a lace-up style for a glove-like fit and silver-tone eyelet hardware for a hint of glimmer. They have a thick sole for added comfort, as well as a removable insole so we can wear them the way that we like best.</p><p>These sneakers are available in both white and black. The white color is a soft cream on the upper, laces and rubber toe and sole, which really lets the red peekaboo heart pop. There’s also a thick, black stripe on the back of the heel with white contrast stitching. If we’d rather have a black sneaker (or want both), we can have one! The black option has white contrast stitching, laces, toe and sole, as well as the contrasting white stripe on the heel. Of course, this option also includes the red heart on the outside of both the left and right shoe.</p><p>We love how the stamped half-heart instantly elevates this “street-ready” sneaker. It’s playful, but designer, so we can show off our own versatility while wearing them. We also love how easily these go with so many outfits. One shopper said they wear them with anything, “from a pair of jeans to a dress.”</p><p>While we’d wear these shoes all year long in a heartbeat, we’re currently eyeing them for a Valentine’s Day outfit. The heart detail is perfect! If we’re not dressing up super fancy and wearing heels, we can pair these sneakers with jeans and a blouse, or even <a href=# rel=noopener>a little black dress</a>. Feel free to wear them for dates all year round, including ones with friends! These sneakers are also available in <a href=# rel=noopener>men’s sizes</a> if we want to be all cutesy and coordinate, which we do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Converse-Comme-des-Garcons-Sneaker-White.jpg><p>Another benefit of these sneakers is that they’re totally comfortable. We don’t need to turn to clunky walking sneakers if we’re going to be standing and walking around all day. Shoppers say they “can walk in them all day long” without complaints, making them great for jobs that keep us on our feet, trips to the mall, or casual strolls around town.</p><p>Be sure to check out the Shoe Fit Fundamentals size chart to make sure these sneakers will be a perfect fit from day one. Obviously we’re going to want to put these on immediately after taking them out of the box! Who else wears new clothes and shoes as soon as possible when receiving them in the mail? That first try-on is always such a feel-good moment, we wish we could bottle it up!</p><p>We hope to see more collaborations between these two brands in the future, because we can’t get enough of <a href=# rel=noopener>these head-turning sneakers</a>. The best part is that regardless of which color we order, they’ll both match equally as well with whatever outfit we put on. It’s a tough choice, but one that will result in happiness and a fabulous fashion statement no matter what! Wearing our heart on our sleeve is old news; we’re officially wearing our heart on our feet — and we can’t stop making eye contact with it.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel=noopener>Comme des Garcons Play Chuck Taylor Hidden Heart Low Top Sneaker</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>$135</a> at Nordstrom!
