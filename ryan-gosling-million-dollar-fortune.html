His father, Tomas Ray, was a traveling salesman, and his mother, Donna, was a secretary. Since his parents believed in Mormonism, <a href=#>Gosling's life was influenced by </a>their religious beliefs. Gosling did not live in one place as a kid as his father's job required the family to travel a lot. This, however, stopped when he was 13 years old and his parents got divorced.</p><p>Gosling grew up with one sister, and both of them were raised by his mother. While attending school at Lester B. Pearson High School, Gosling had a tough time as he was frequently bullied. Despite all the ordeals, Ryan Gosling has made a dazzling career out of acting, music, and later out of his business ventures. The 40-year-old Canadian actor has an impressive net worth of about $70 million.</p><p>Here is how Ryan Gosling earns and spends his millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-acting-career>Earns: Acting Career</h2><p>Ryan Gosling is reported to have had a music career even before he got launched as an actor in Hollywood. Nevertheless, the primary source of his massive net worth is taken to be his career in the film industry.</p><p>Despite his charm and skills, Ryan Gosling might not be the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but he has still made a decent amount of money from his acting career. After doing some supporting roles, he first starred in Murder by Numbers opposite Sandra Bullock. But Ryan Gosling became a household name only after his breakthrough in 2004’s The Notebook, for which he made about $1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following this, he acted in noteworthy movies like Crazy, Stupid, Love, for which he was paid about $6 million, and <a href=#>the blockbuster La La Land</a>, which earned him about $8 million. The famous sci-fi Blade Runner 2049 earned him a grand sum of about $10 million.</p><h2 id=spends-real-estate>Spends: Real Estate</h2><p>Gosling is known to have lived in New York with his mixed-breed dog Gorge for a while. He then resented the renowned Ridgewood house in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. This property is famous for having housed actresses and musicians; it is also often used for movie shoots.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Check Out Massive House With Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Gosling also lived with Eva Mendes in her LA mansion when they first started dating. Eva sold this mansion for about $125 million in 2014 after she had already married Gosling. The Couple’s current residence is in Los Feliz, where they live a lavish but private life with their two daughters. This mansion has a price of about $48 million. It comes with luxury amenities, including six bedrooms, three bathrooms, living rooms, outdoor living spaces, a gourmet kitchen, and three en-suites, among other things.</p><h2 id=earns-entrepreneurship>Earns: Entrepreneurship</h2><p>Besides having owned and rented different luxury estates at different times, Ryan Gosling has also purchased a restaurant with his business partner. It is a Moroccan restaurant that goes by ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tagine</a>.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This restaurant is located in the well-liked area of Beverly Hills, where <a href=#>many celebrity stars are known to reside</a>. It is rumored that he bought this restaurant impulsively and then spent about a year changing its getup. However, he is quite proud of it now and is in charge of overseeing the menu.</p><h2 id=spends-philanthropy>Spends: Philanthropy</h2><p>Ryan Gosling might not be the billionaire celebrity star of Hollywood, but he spends his millions in the noblest ways possible. Gosling is a philanthropist who funds more than one organization or foundation.</p><p>He is a dog owner, and it looks like he has a special spot for animals when it comes to doing charity. He donates to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">organizations like</a> PETA and Mercy for Animals. Other than that, he also funds the Silverlake Conservatory of Music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-music-career>Earns: Music Career</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Rayan Gosling’s professional life began not with acting but with music. Fans were reminded of how great a singer and musician Gosling is through his performance in La La Land's superhit movie.</p><p>Gosling began exhibiting his musical skills as a kid when he and his sister sang at weddings before joining a ballet company. His first breakthrough in music came when he landed a role as a Mouseketeer on the Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. He was part of the Mickey Mouse Club from 1933 to1934 when he got to perform alongside <a href=#>future stars like Justin Timberlake</a> and Britney Spears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling did get busy with his acting, but he got back to music professionally when he released an album with his pal Zach Shields. The band and the album were called Dead Man’s Bones - a collaboration with the Silverlake Conservatory Children's Choir.</p><h2 id=spends-cars>Spends: Cars</h2><p>Ryan Gosling is not very keen on flaunting his riches, but he does own a fairly impressive collection of cars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He owns</a> a black Prius, and his 1973 Malibu is particularly famous because that is precisely the car featured in the movie Drive.</p><p>The Chevelle is a bit out of fashion at the moment, but it was a big deal once upon a time. Moreover, it is particularly close to Gosling as he helped develop this car during the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling might be a private person, but he is a role model when it comes to <a href=#>earning some fancy bucks and spending it</a> in the best ways possible. He is also the example of a very versatile and talented actor who has only gotten better over his long-lasting and successful career.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Many Directions Zayn Malik Spends & Earns His Millions</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesda.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GO Banking Rates</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men’s Health</a>, <a href=#>Real Estate Agent</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fuq3NZp6oq5yeu6h5zKKjpaGfo3qlu8ulmKtllqS%2FtcHNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./comfywithkerry-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-284009-html.html><span>←</span><span>Comfywithkerry Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
