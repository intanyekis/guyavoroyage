She had even picked September as her month of choice to tie the knot. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mamelak had to postpone&nbsp;her wedding. The couple is now set&nbsp;to get married in 2021, and they have even decided on a particular date for the occasion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Kayla Mamelak started Dating Adam Altus Back in 2015</h2><p>Kayla Mamelak has been with her fiance Adam Altus for quite a while now. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;reveals that the first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture</a>&nbsp;she ever posted with Adam Altus was on January 28, 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the post, they can be seen wearing winter clothes and sitting in the snow in front of&nbsp;a snowman in the picture. And if the picture alone didn’t hint that they were dating at the time, the caption sure gave more than a few clues about their relationship at the time.</p><p>The caption of the post read, “4 movies later, building a snowman seemed like a good idea (juno).”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>These humorously crafted texts could mean that they had just started dating together at that time. But, it could just as easily mean that they had finished watching four movies just that particular day and decided to build a snowman for a change. Your guess is as good as ours! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Either way, it seems that Mamelak and Altus have been going out since at least 2015. And now, the couple is ready to take their relationship to the next level.</p><h2>Mamelak and Altus got Engaged in July 2019</h2><p>Adam Altus took the initiative to take their relationship to a new phase. Therefore, in July 2019, he proposed to her, and she gratefully accepted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mamelak announced the good news to the world through a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>&nbsp;on her Instagram in July 2019. She posted a picture where Altus can be seen on one knee, presenting a ring to Mamelak.&nbsp;Mamelak was joyfully surprised by her now-fiance’s move, which took place in a public space by the looks of it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And to end that&nbsp;year on a high note, she chose to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>&nbsp;the almost-same picture with the caption “best.year.ever” on December 31, 2019.</p><h2>The Couple Had&nbsp;Planned To Get Married In September 2020</h2><p>Mamelak and Altus had decided that the perfect time to get married would be just over a year after their engagement. Therefore, they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">decided</a>&nbsp;on September 6, 2020, to be their wedding day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple had even created an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">online registry</a> of their wedding with Zola.&nbsp;However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a halt, and their marriage plans were no exception. Due to lockdowns and whatnot, they had to postpone their wedding to a later date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And their Zola registry page currently shows an update that reads, “Due to COVID-19, we’ve decided to postpone our wedding. Your health and safety are our top priority, and we hope you’ll save our new date. We wish you and your loved ones all the best and look forward to celebrating together!”</p><p>But the couple has already decided on another date. The registry shows that the next date for their nuptials is 23 May 2021. That means that if everything goes fine, we will get to see these two say their vows just over seven months from now.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mamelak And Altus still Celebrated on Their Would-Have-Been Wedding Day</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Nevertheless, not being able to have a proper wedding did not stop the two from having a little fun on their own on the day that they were supposed to get married.</p><p>Along with two of their friends, Mamelak and Altus still had a little <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ceremony</a>. They celebrated by having their wedding cake decorated with the words “Happy Corona Wedding.” They also made the moment memorable with&nbsp; some drinks, and a hanging decoration that read “Soon To Be Mr. & Mrs.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Mamelak posted pictures of this occasion on her Instagram on September 7, 2020, with the caption “Not exactly the wedding weekend we planned, but still perfect nonetheless.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All this suggests that they cannot wait to get married to one another and spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CuurjAZqSapZWhrqx5zJqpq6GVmXupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boobypack-shark-tank.html><span>←</span><span>Boobypack Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth, and Investment</span></a>
