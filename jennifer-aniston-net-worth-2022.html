And with all the love in the world, my mom looked at me and said, ‘Oh, honey, you’re so funny.’ So, she doesn’t lie to me…she answers the question by not answering and instead tells me what she thinks is my greatest strength.”</p><p>“For the last year and a half, I went from being a crazy workout girl to sort of saying, “My body wants a little bit an of a break.” So I kind of stay with more simple stuff and taking walks and not being neurotic about working out and eating right. I started to enjoy life a little bit more. The only downside to that is there are that couple extra pounds and about 4,000 pregnancy rumors, but you know, other than that, it feels great.”</p><p>“I think it’s important to have closure in any relationship that ends – from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.”</p><p>“There are many stages of grief. It’s sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way — cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I’m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren’t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqdkp52kYsSwvtOhZGtoYmd8c32RaWho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hussein-fatal-dead-rapper-tupac-shakur-collaborator-dies-at-38-2015137.html><span>←</span><span>Hussein Fatal Dead: Rapper, Tupac Shakur Collaborator Dies at 38</span></a>
