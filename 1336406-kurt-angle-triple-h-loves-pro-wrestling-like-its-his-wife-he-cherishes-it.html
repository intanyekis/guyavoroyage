Angle put over both Triple H and Hulk Hogan.</p><p>“For me personally, Triple H. He’s always had it,” Kurt Angle said. “He’s not just from a wrestling standpoint, but from a creative standpoint, from a psychology standpoint, from a promo standpoint. Triple H is one guy that is so well-educated. He loves pro-wrestling like it’s his wife. Okay? He cherishes it, and he’s really good at it. He has a great mind for it. In the past, I would say somebody like Hulk Hogan, who was able to bring the fans in at a time when wrestling was not so hot, but Hulkamania actually made wrestling so much bigger. And he has a great mind for the business as well. I worked with Hulk Hogan, and he definitely is well educated with the wrestling aspect.”</p><p>When asked who he’d like to compete against at WrestleMania if he were to return for one more match, Angle named <a href=#>Ricochet</a>, <a href=#>Braun Strowman</a>, and former IMPACT Wrestling rival <a href=#>AJ Styles</a>.</p><p>“Oh, man. Well, I’m not that stupid. So I’m gonna make sure it’s a young guy,” Kurt Angle admitted. “Because I’m a little bit older. I lost a little bit of a step. And I would have to say someone like AJ Styles or Ricochet. I really like that kid. I think I would have an incredible match with him. One of the bigger guys, Braun Strowman. I would love to wrestle with Braun. He is so athletic for his size. He reminds me a lot of Brock Lesnar with his athleticism. He’s not as athletic as Brock. He’s pretty close. But those guys, I think, would carry me pretty well through that match.”</p><p>What do you make of Kurt Angle’s comments?
