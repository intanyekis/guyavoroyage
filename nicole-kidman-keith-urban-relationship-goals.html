Keith Urban is a world-renowned 52-year-old country music star from New Zealand. Nicole Kidman is a 52-year-old Hawaiian born, American/Australian citizen and world-renowned Emmy award-winning actress. Both lived in Australia for part of their lives before moving to the United States. After meeting in 2005 each other at an award show, Keith Urban contacted Nicole Kidman and they went on several motorcycle riding dates around New York.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Times Nick Jonas & Priyanka Chopra Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p>They were married the following year. Since then they have had two children who they have kept out of the media's eye, and live a fulfilling life together. Here are 10 times Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban were relationship goals.</p><h2 id=when-they-sang-a-wedding-song-together>When They Sang A Wedding Song Together</h2><p>Nothing is more powerful in bringing two souls together than a wedding. The more everyone participates in the wedding, the more magical it becomes for guests and family alike. Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman are family people and love making things just right for everyone.</p><p>For a family's <a href=#>wedding</a> in Italy, they sang “The Wedding Song” together on stage for the family, having a good time and letting everyone jump in and enjoy an Elton John song titled “Your Song.”They traded verses and thoroughly enjoyed themselves, which was an authentic and enjoyable experience for the wedding guests and emotional for the bride and groom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-had-their-children>When They Had Their Children</h2><p>Nicole Kidman has four children, two with Kieth Urban. With her and Keith’s pregnancy being the first one to not to end in miscarriage, there's something special to that. She adopted her first two children while married to <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>. She had a very painful ectopic pregnancy back then but was strong enough after her marriage with Kieth Urban to try again, and this time succeeded and had her first daughter, Sunday Rose.</p><p>In 2010, the couple made the choice to have a second child, and Faith Margaret was born. The strength to go from two miscarriages to having two births is amazing, and support from Kieth and sheer willpower from Nicole Kidman is admirable.</p><h2 id=when-nicole-kidman-surprised-keith-urban-with-roses-for-his-birthday>When Nicole Kidman Surprised Keith Urban With Roses For His Birthday</h2><p>For Keith Urban's 52nd birthday he got a surprise he wasn't expecting. Roses, balloons, and wrapped presents from his wife. He was delighted by the table full of surprises and posted a photo on Instagram to exclaim his appreciation. The couple celebrated after a trip to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Italy</a> for his birthday party. They have been married since 2006 and have two daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Nicole Kidman Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Nicole Kidman posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> photos with captions about her love for her husband and her happiness in her marriage. After 13 years of marriage, they still show that they love each other and that simple gifts are the most valuable.</p><h2 id=when-they-were-jealous-of-each-other>When They Were Jealous Of Each Other</h2><p>Everyone in a relationship gets jealous sometimes. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban were having a whole jealousy debacle when a female singer opened for a Keith Urban show. Although the facts had been smudged, he and the female singer had nothing going on and the rumor was started by a gossip website.</p><p>One month later Kieth supposedly was jealous of Nicole Kidman being too close to one of her costars. This was also rubbish and was started by a gossip website. There were many cases of gossip websites starting rumors, but the couple trusted each other and knew that they could handle websites lying about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-kieth-urban-stopped-drinking-for-her>When Kieth Urban Stopped Drinking For Her</h2><p>Keith Urban stopped drinking the year him and Nicole Kidman got married. He had always wanted to stop drinking and focus on love and his relationships, but until Nicole Kidman staged an intervention, he never was able to quit. He admitted that drugs and alcohol were affecting his life in a way that he couldn't control, and triggered deep depression that there was no end to.</p><p>Until the intervention was staged the only solution was drugs. They live happily now and Nicole supports his sobriety. He has been sober for 13 years and, despite a few recent debunked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tabloid stories</a>, is doing very well.</p><h2 id=how-they-met>How They Met</h2><p>They each had a crush on each other at least four months prior to actually talking on the phone to each other. While she and Keith met at the awards party and they noticed each other eyeing one another, it took Keith four months to get up the courage to call her. He said that everything needed to settle and that their relationship was life-beginning for him as opposed to life-changing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Times Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p>Their first dates were motorcycle rides around<a href=#> New York</a>, and she knew she wanted to marry him after only one month of dating. At their wedding, Kieth Urban cried with joy when she lifted the veil.</p><h2 id=how-they-don-t-post-their-children-s-photos-online>How They Don’t Post Their Children’s Photos Online</h2><p>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban aren't like most celebrities in this day and age. They certainly avoid posting photos of their daughters online and don't cause big scenes as most celebrities do. They stay humble and save those photos for special occasions. One of those occasions was their daughter’s Sunday's birthday. She turned 11 in July, and to celebrate they visited Paris and posted a photo of their daughters looking out of a clocktower over the city.</p><p>Besides the occasional paparazzi photo, this is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a rare photo</a> of the family being posted online for the public to see. They keep their children out of the limelight, allowing them to live normal lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-nickname-for-him>Her Nickname For Him</h2><p>Cute nicknames are vital to relationships, maybe not vital, but everyone has heard one before. They are a name that is only used for that significant other who means so much to you, that calling them by their actual name just isn't acceptable. Nicole Kidman has a great nickname for Kieth Urban. She calls him her Aussie Beach Boy, which is extremely fitting. She calls him that because the two times he's his hottest is when he's on the beach or when he's playing guitar, according to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Guys Who Were Lucky Enough to Date Kaley Cuoco</a></span></p><p>Telling the public about her nickname for Kieth just goes to show how down-to-earth Nicole is about expressing love for her husband.</p><h2 id=keith-urban-s-celebration-after-winning-awards>Keith Urban’s Celebration After Winning Awards</h2><p>Keith Urban took home Entertainer of the Year at the <i>CMA Awards</i>, and after he was announced winner he celebrated by planting a giant kiss on Nicole Kidman. After a long kiss with his wife, he ran over to the other nominees and gave them a big hug showing his character and sportsmanship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is not the only awards <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ceremony</a> he's done this at. At the 54th Annual <i>ACM Awards</i>, he also took home Entertainer of the Year and did the same thing. He gave Nicole Kidman a long, giant kiss, and then ran over and hugged the other nominees.</p><h2 id=keith-urban-s-description-of-nicole-kidman>Keith Urban’s description of Nicole Kidman</h2><p>Everyone has a way to describe their significant other in one sentence, but would rather not share it with the entire world. Keith Urban released a track called “Gemini” in which he said that sentence loud and clear. Describing Nicole Kidman as a maniac in the bed, but a brainiac in the head, he stirred up some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy</a> in the news.</p><p>At 52, Nicole Kidman couldn't help but laugh and tell the media that she doesn't censor his music, and would rather be complimented than be called boring. Although there were some other scandalous revealing lines in the album, she wouldn't comment.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Times Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnp6wsLjEZqKinJ2Wu263xKKroWWlp6%2BiuoyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmn5%2BWubR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tootie-tootz.html><span>←</span><span>Tootie Tootz</span></a>
