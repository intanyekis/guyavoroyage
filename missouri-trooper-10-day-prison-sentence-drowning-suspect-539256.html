He knows he’s guilty and he’s damn lucky to get what he got.”</p><p>According to the outlet, Anthony Piercy, an 18-year highway patrol veteran, must also complete two years probation and&nbsp;50 hours of community service as part of his sentence. At the time of Ellingson’s death, Piercy had recently begun doing boat patrol when his department started working with safety patrol.</p><p>In 2014, Piercy arrested Ellingson&nbsp;on Lake of the Ozarks for suspicion of boating while intoxicated. According to reports, Piercy handcuffed him and put him in a life vest incorrectly. The vest reportedly came off when Ellingson was knocked off the boat when a wave struck, leading him to drown. On Tuesday (Sept. 19) during sentencing, Craig Ellingson faced Piercy for the first time and didn’t hold back his grief and anger.</p><p>“Anthony Piercy, it has been almost 3 1/2 years that I’ve waited to tell you face-to-face that you’re the reason why my son Brandon is dead,” he said according to The Kansas City Star. “You had no compassion for my son.”</p><p>Piercy pled guilty to a lesser boating charge in connection with&nbsp;Ellingson’s death, avoiding an involuntary manslaughter charge. He&nbsp;addressed Ellingson’s father and apologized for his part in his son’s death.</p><p>“I apologize for the loss that I have caused the Ellingson family,” Piercy reportedly said from the defense table. “I know that nothing that I will say will ease the pain that they are feeling. I will never forget that I am the cause of that pain. I am truly sorry for that. Brandon should be here with them today. Thank you.”</p><p>Prosecutors were upset with&nbsp;Judge Roger Prokes’ ruling; they had pushed for a 30-day sentence and having Piercy’s&nbsp;law-enforcement certificate revoked for life. As of now, Piercy is still with the department but on unpaid leave.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2tL%2FOrqmiZaSnvLC8xKtkamhdma66ec%2BroKynnmLAprrTnqWcnV2Zv7DDzaKloGWjqsCxscKtZG5raWeCd3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./high-school-student-fort-lauderdale-dies.html><span>←</span><span>High School Student Fort Lauderdale Dies After Jumping From Building</span></a>
