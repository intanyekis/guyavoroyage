The rights to the story and a New York Magazine&nbsp;article following the infamous story were the subject of a major bidding war, which Netflix won out in 2018, per&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. This isn’t the only time that creepy story has inspired a production. A movie also titled&nbsp;The Watcher&nbsp;was released in 2016 and was inspired by the events, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><h2>Who’s in the cast for The Watcher?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>These are the cast members confirmed for&nbsp;The Watcher:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Watcher-Netflix-embed-3.jpg><ul><li><strong>Jennifer Coolidge&nbsp;</strong>as Karen Calhoun.&nbsp;The White Lotus&nbsp;star is one of the biggest names for the series.

The Brannocks receive a letter from “The Watcher.” He tells the family that their house is “my obsession. And now you are too.” The family begins questioning everyone around them as weird and terrifying happen around the house. “I will never stop watching,” The Watcher vows.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The first teaser was released on September 9. The footage features Jennifer Coolidge as the realtor talking up the 657 Boulevard house in New Jersey. The teaser does give a glamorous look at the mansion, with Jennifer complimenting the many aspects of the home, along with the amenities. Even though it’s bright and makes the home look inviting, there is one moment where Jennifer hints at the menacing nature of the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After showing a bedroom curtain, she advises them to keep the windows closed. “You want to keep the curtains closed. There’s a lot of weird neighbors and stuff out there, and you know, you don’t want them watching you. That’s for sure,” she said. While it’s not clear if any of this footage is used in the show, it does give a feel for what Jennifer’s portrayal of the realtor will be like!</p><h2>Who is the creator?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ryan-murphy-e-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>The mastermind behind&nbsp;The Watcher&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan Murphy</a>,&nbsp;</strong>who has also created major hits like&nbsp;American Horror Story, and&nbsp;Glee.&nbsp;It’s probably safe to assume that the new show will have more in common with&nbsp;AHS&nbsp;than the musical sitcom. Ryan co-created the series with&nbsp;<strong>Ian Brennan,&nbsp;</strong>who worked alongside him as a writer and producer for both&nbsp;Glee&nbsp;and&nbsp;Scream Queens. Ian was also a writer and producer for the horror comedy&nbsp;Cooties.</p><h2>What’s the show about?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The thriller’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>description</a> on Netflix describes the show’s dark suburban thriller themes. “Ominous letters. Strange neighbors. Sinister threats. A family moves into their suburban dream home, only to discover they’ve inherited a nightmare,” it reads.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>As previously mentioned, the series is based on a 2018&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Magazine</a>&nbsp;article chronicling the true story of the Broaddus family. The Broadduses had purchased a home in Westfield, New Jersey in 2014 for $1.3 million, and were planning to make their move into when they started receiving disturbing and mysterious letters from an unknown person, who identified themself simply as “The Watcher.” The letters were shocking to say the least. “657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming,” The Watcher wrote, claiming that other members of their family had watched the home. “It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The family continued to receive letters from the anonymous letter writer, requesting that they fill the house with “young blood.” The Broaddus family tried to figure out who had written the letters to no avail. To this day, it’s still not clear who had left the series of disturbing letters, but a number of different theories have circulated, ranging from neighbors, the previous owners, and even the Broadduses themselves. The family tried to sue the previous owners and explored options to sell or rent the home. The family finally managed to sell their home in August 2019 at a loss for $959,000, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGavkamwqbHRZqWerJahtrl50p6pop2jYoF5gJhyaG1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vivica-fox-soulja-boy-50-cent-responds-385814.html><span>←</span><span>Vivica A.
