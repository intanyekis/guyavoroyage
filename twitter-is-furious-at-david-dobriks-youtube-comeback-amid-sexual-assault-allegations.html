Looks like his net worth isn't that much of a problem...yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Wittek Defends David Dobrik During 'Frenemies' Interview</a></span></p><p>Twitter users are furious about his return and can hardly believe that Dobrik was able to get away from&nbsp;his controversial video without being held accountable for it.</p><p>In a 2018 video, Dobrik recorded a vlog featuring his Vlog Squad friends and a group of women who were invited to hang out with them. It was later revealed that they were invited to perform&nbsp;sexual activities with Vlog Squad member Dominic Zeglaitis, and&nbsp;despite being hesitant, were persuaded&nbsp;into giving in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This situation was treated as a&nbsp;humorous one&nbsp;for David's video, and only after a woman from the vlog <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused Dominic Zeglaitis of rape in an Insider report</a>, was the video taken seriously.</p><p>Dobrik was pressured to release&nbsp;an apology (which didn't really seem like one) and lost subscribers and major brand deals. He never apologized or took responsibility for what happened behind-the-scenes, and Internet users&nbsp;are furious at his return to YouTube now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Peck Still Follows David Dobrik On Instagram Despite Vlog Squad Backlash</a></span></p><p>"it's insane that ppl immediately forgot about the entire situation and he didn't make a sincere apology.." a user wrote in response to the video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"of course he gets to act like it [the incident] never happened after this," wrote another Twitter user.</p><p>"the fact that he's just able to come back like nothing happened, but those girls who were sexually assaulted are gonna be traumatised for the rest of their life, is proof that accusations of sexual assault doesn't always harm a man's career" read another reply.</p><p>"Why does it have so many views?" asked a user, referring to the new video having 3.2 million views.
