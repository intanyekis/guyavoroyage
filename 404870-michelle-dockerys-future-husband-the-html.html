So everything "shut down" after he was gone. She never lost hope that he would survive when he was still alive. Despite fighting what became a losing battle, he, too, remained strong and "never complained."</p><p class=dh>Around the same time the tragedy befell her, Dockery's character's storyline in "Downton Abbey" mimicked her own, as Lady Mary had also lost her husband. Dockery said she considered herself a widow like Lady Mary because she felt that she and Dineen were "married at heart."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbXBnZXqutcKhnKWklWKxsK%2FKnqmyq12bwrXB0Z5koa2jl66vsIytn55mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-guadagno.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Guadagno Governor Bio, Facts, Married, Husband, Kids, Net Worth, Salary</span></a>
