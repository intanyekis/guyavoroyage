So it’s really hard to determine what moment matters more than others, especially with a new song. But there’s the dance, the wardrobe, the lighting, how long you stay in a song, the fact that the audience may sing along&nbsp;… It’s a lot. So I’m trying my hardest not to overthink it,” Ursher explained of the set.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He did describe the <a href=#>30-year-moment-in-the-making</a> as “an event,” and confirmed that there will be special guests. He also shared that he did consider performing new music, but didn’t confirm or deny its inclusion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When planning his show, the 45-year-old revealed to the outlet that he’s “watched every performer, analyzing how they maximized those 12 minutes.

I want to celebrate the 30 years of this career where I’m very fortunate to have made songs and moments with people that they will remember forever.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234734726>Halftime Show</a> is Usher’s first performance since concluding his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234643313>Las Vegas residency</a>.
