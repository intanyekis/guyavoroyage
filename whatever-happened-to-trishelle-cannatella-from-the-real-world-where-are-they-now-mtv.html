Both The Real World and Road Rules gave rise to some <a href=#>popular names</a>, including Trishelle Cannatella.</p><p>Let's take a look back at The Real World and see what Trishelle is up to now.</p><h2 id=39-the-real-world-39-is-an-mtv-classic>'The Real World' Is An MTV Classic</h2><p>When looking at the history of reality TV, few shows come close to matching the legacy of The Real World. The premise was simple, yet brilliant, and MTV executed the first season flawlessly, which gave rise to a massive franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, The Real World was the thing to watch on MTV, and even when Road Rules came into play, fans still made sure to keep watching The Real World. The drama was simply too compelling, and MTV always did an outstanding job in finding participants that could keep fans coming back for more.</p><p>Through the years, fans got to see many individuals become famous thanks to their time on the show, with some even becoming stars in other industries. Just like what Mike Mizanin, better known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Miz</a>, has done in the WWE.</p><p>The series eventually played a pivotal role in Trishelle Cannatella becoming a star for the network.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Lesser-Known Facts About MTV 'Challenge' Fan-Favorite, Derrick Kosinski</a></span></p><h2 id=trishelle-rose-to-fame-on-the-show>Trishelle Rose To Fame On The Show</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, The Real World: Las Vegas made its debut on MTV, and in no time at all, the series gave way to notable names and incidents. This was the season that featured Trishelle Cannatella, who remains one of the most infamous figures in MTV history.</p><p>Trishelle's relationship with Steven was a major talking point, as was her partying ways. Suffice to say that she was everything that MTV was hoping for.</p><p>Thanks to her season, Trishelle was suddenly everywhere, and millions of people knew who she was, regardless of whether they had seen the show or not.</p><p>When speaking on the fame she found and whether or not she felt it, Trishelle said, "No! It did not! Because we were broke. I got a job in Westwood at some restaurant waiting tables, and when the previews were coming out for the show, my tables started stopping me and they were like, 'Are you that girl that’s about to be on ‘The Real World’ on MTV?' And I was just like, 'Yeah.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, posing in Playboy and making money with appearances was suddenly lucrative for Trishelle, who was cashing in on her really star name.</p><p>It's been nearly 20 year since The Real World: Las Vegas, and fans want to know what Trishelle is up to these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Romances That Have Come From MTVs 'The Challenge'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-she-39-s-doing-now>What She's Doing Now?</h2><p>So, what has Trishelle been up to since becoming a popular name on MTV all those years ago? Turns out, she's been up to quite a bit, including a recent return to MTV, as well as a surprise appearance on another reality show that no one saw coming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just this year, Trishelle took part in The Challenge: All Stars, which came as quite a surprise to fans. She was gone for years, and suddenly, she was right back in the thick of things on MTV.</p><p>Despite the time away, Trishelle made sure to just have fun instead of undergoing intense preparation for the show's physical challenges.</p><p>"I did not train for it. Mark Long has been a friend of mine for, God, almost 20 years, and he told me, “It’s not gonna be that serious!” Because I was really stressed out. I said, “Mark, I haven’t taken a jog around the block in maybe a decade.” And so he’s like, “You’re fine, you’re fine!” When I got there, I was semi-expecting them to take it a little bit easy on us because we are older? But they did not," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MTV aside, Trishelle would also make a surprise appearance on Married at First Sight, as one of her friends was married on the show's New Orleans season. This occured last year, and her appearance made headlines in a hurry, as it painted her in a less than flattering light.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The Reboot Of ‘The Real World’</a></span></p><p>Outside of television, Trishelle is happily married and thriving in her personal life. She is not as infamous as she once was, but there is no denying that she'll always be a piece of reality TV history.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Real World: Austin': Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkmsOmvoyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStqpmotaa4y55knJmeo661sculmGaeoqS6bsDHnmSrnZGheri70aWbZq%2BYmr%2BmecCrnGasmJrGbrrOsGSmrKZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-mckenney-daughter-partner-husband-html.html><span>←</span><span>Todd McKenney: Fathered Daughter &amp;amp; Forgot, Witnessed Partner Marry Sister</span></a>
