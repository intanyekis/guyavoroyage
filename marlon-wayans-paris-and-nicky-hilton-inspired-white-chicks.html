They were so big and was the gateway to pop culture send up. We did that film in good spirit to celebrate a special time in all of our lives. So thank you paris and Nikki [sic] for being muses. Love ya.”</p><p>He also implied that he would be down to a sequel, especially if the Hilton sisters would agree to collaborate on it. “When we do #whitechicks2 ‘let’s go shopping,'” he joked.</p><p><a href=#>The It Girl herself responded</a> to Marlon’s post, writing, “Great seeing you last night.☺️ That movie was hilarious AF.” And if White Chicks 2 does happen, she’s seemingly down to participate: “Love you too bro and yes let us know.”</p><p>Nicky, 37, also responded to <a href=#>the news of her muse status</a> via Twitter. “Lololol,” she wrote on Thursday, July 1. “Happy we inspired you ⁦@MarlonWayans⁩! 😹 Epic movie!”</p><p>Directed by Shawn and Marlon’s older brother <strong>Keenen Ivory Wayans</strong>, White Chicks premiered in 2004 to fairly scathing reviews but <a href=#>became a comedy classic</a> nonetheless.
