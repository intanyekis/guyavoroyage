Jem Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Been given 24 hours
To tie up loose ends
To make amends
His eyes said it all
I started to fall
And the silence deafened
Head spinning round
No time to sit down Just wanted to
Run and run and run
Be careful they say
Don't wish life away,
Now I've one dayAnd I can't believe
How I've been wasting my time"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The lyrics describe the urgency of their situation, with the singer having no time to sit down and think about what they need to do. The silence around them is deafening, and their head is spinning, but they just want to run and run and run. The song suggests that the singer has been wasting their time and finally realizes what really matters to them in their final hours.</p><br><p>As the song progresses, the singer asks the questions that many people ask when confronted with their own mortality: is there a heaven or hell, and will they come back? They start to see things clearer, realizing that the places they've been and the people they've seen are what truly matter. The plans they've made start to fade as the sun sets, and they come to terms with the fact that they won't grow old as they once thought they would.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, there is an underlying message of redemption and the desire to live free. The singer asks for others' blessings and promises to live free, knowing that they won't have the chance to do it themselves. The song ends with the singer feeling a sense of peace, knowing they're not alone and that everything they've said they meant.</p><br><p>Overall, "24" is a powerful song that explores universal themes of mortality, redemption, and the preciousness of life. It encourages listeners to appreciate the people and experiences in their lives and not waste time on things that don't matter.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Been given 24 hours</u><br>Jem has been given only 24 hours to finish all his unfinished business</p><br><p><u>To tie up loose ends</u><br>Jem needs to finish his incomplete tasks and do anything that is necessary.</p><br><p><u>To make amends</u><br>Jem needs to make things right with those he has had conflicts with in the past.</p><br><p><u>His eyes said it all</u><br>Jem is feeling remorseful and his eyes are communicating his sorrowful state.</p><br><p><u>I started to fall</u><br>Jem began to feel a sense of desperation and despair due to the immense pressure and lack of time.</p><br><p><u>And the silence deafened</u><br>Even though Jem feels the pressure, he is trying to concentrate without noises distracting him.</p><br><p><u>Head spinning round</u><br>Jem is feeling dizzy from the emotions and stresses that he is experiencing.</p><br><p><u>No time to sit down</u><br>Jem has a lot to do and is finding it hard to get a break.</p><br><p><u>Just wanted to Run and run and run</u><br>Jem feels the need to be in constant motion to complete everything in time.</p><br><p><u>Be careful they say</u><br>People advise Jem to be careful because one should value and cherish every moment, even during difficult times.</p><br><p><u>Don't wish life away</u><br>One should not want to pass the time quickly or have a negative outlook on life.</p><br><p><u>Now I've one day</u><br>Jem has only one day left to have a impact on the people he loves and make a change in his life.</p><br><p><u>And I can't believe How I've been wasting my time</u><br>In the limited time that he has remaining, Jem is realizing how he has spent his life until this point in a futile manner.</p><br><p><u>In 24 hours they'll belaying flowers On my life, it's over tonight</u><br>Jem's time is running out, and soon after he will die.</p><br><p><u>I'm not messing no I Need your blessing And your promise to live free Please do it for me</u><br>Jem wants a meaningful existence even beyond his death, one in which his loved ones will continue to live without any regrets.</p><br><p><u>Is there a heaven a hell And will I come back Who can tell</u><br>Jem wonders if his soul will still exist after his death, which will live on eternally in heaven or hell.</p><br><p><u>Now I can see What matters to me It's as clear as crystal</u><br>Jem is gaining more understanding of what is important to him as his life comes to an end.</p><br><p><u>The places I've been The people I've seen Plans that I made Start to fade The sun's setting gold Thought I would grow old, It wasn't to be</u><br>Jem reflects on the memories and impressions he has from his life that are disappearing into the past as he reaches his final moments.</p><br><p><u>In 18 hours they'll belaying flowers On my life, it's over tonight</u><br>Jem's remaining time is decreasing, and soon all that will be left is his memory.</p><br><p><u>In 13 hours they'll belaying flowers On my life, it's over tonight</u><br>Jem's time is running out, and he is soon to be dead.</p><br><p><u>I'm not alone, I sense it, I sense it All that I said, I meant it, I meant it</u><br>Even though Jem is going to die soon, the sense of assurance that he is with his loved ones keeps him going.
