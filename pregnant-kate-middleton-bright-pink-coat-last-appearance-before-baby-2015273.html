Stepping out for the last time before her royal maternity leave begins, pregnant Kate Middleton, who has a month to go until her due date, attended the first of three engagements in one day on Friday, March 27, in South East London.
For the appearance, the Duchess of Cambridge, 33, rocked a shocking pink, double-breasted Mulberry coat—the same coat she wore to visit the 9/11 Memorial in NYC this past December."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She also added a simple black clutch. And, of course, the royal had her hair blown-out into her signature, bouncy style.</p><p>Nearby, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> looked like Prince Charming in his navy, single-breasted suit, which he teamed with a purple tie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At the first of their three engagements, the royal couple visited the <a href=#>Stephen Lawrence Centre</a> in Deptford.

Middleton also snagged a seat in a children’s classroom, where the youngsters were learning about the British court system.</p><p>Outside the center, one member of the public was overheard wishing Prince William good luck with the baby. The Duke of Cambridge replied, “Thank you! Not long now,” and also described the arrival of his second child as a family “game changer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After that, the royal couple were expected to visit XLP in Gipsy Hill, London, where young performers in the organization’s arts program would put on a presentation for the Cambridges.
