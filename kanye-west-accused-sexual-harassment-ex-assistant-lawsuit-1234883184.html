She claims West offered her $1,000,000 to drop her adult-content job and become his “God like” executive/personal assistant. Pisciotta said that the job description consisted of being on-call for the Chicagoan 24/7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1186140733.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The woman says that when she began working for Yeezy, he started to<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713937> behave inappropriately</a>, including sending her explicit text messages and pleasuring himself. Pisciotta claims that he sent her one message that read: “See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I’m f**king them. Then I want her to cheat on me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In another message, she alleges that the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234779257>ex-husband of Kim Kardashian </a>wrote: “Is my d*ck racist? I’m going to stare at pictures of white women with black a**es and beat the sh*t out of my racist d*ck.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, the former assistant says West was “fixated” on knowing the size of her boyfriend’s penis and would unsolicitedly send her footage of him sexually engaging with models.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pisciotta recalled two times witnessing the 46-year-old pleasuring himself – once while on the phone with her, and another time when he allegedly locked himself in a room with her during a private flight to Paris. She says the Grammy-winner then laid down on a bed and masturbated under covers until he fell asleep.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to Pisciotta, Ye let her go in October 2022 after she allegedly turned down a $4,000,000 offer to be his Chief of Staff.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The adult-content creator is now suing West for wrongful termination and breach of contract. She claims she’s owed a $3,000,000 severance package that was promised, but never paid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cur8XEZq6eq6RirqSv1KycnWWjmsW2rctmn5qqkajArrHNrWSesF2WwLS10q2Yp6xdoa64v9Siq2ZpYmiBeYSSam9tZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-levin-dating-breakup-exboyfriend-boyfriend-networth.html><span>←</span><span>Is YouTuber Rachel Levin Dating Someone?
