The catch is that people who collect and obsess over coins and other types of currency, or numismatists as they prefer to be called, are extremely particular about the quality and appearance of the tiny pieces of money they hold so dear. An entire system of grading exists to determine the quality of an individual coin, ranging from 1 all the way to 70, and the difference in a single point can be worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>It should go without saying that coins worth six or seven figures are exceedingly rare, and just how hard it is to find them can play a huge role in the price tag they receive. It also takes quite some time before a coin becomes valuable, so unfortunately, the odds of a person unknowingly having a valuable piece in their piggy banks are virtually nonexistent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Generally speaking, the only way to attain such a pricey piece of metal is through auctions, and with every hungry collector constantly checking the circuit for the prettiest and rarest coins around means simply being in attendance at the right time is in no way a guarantee to walk out of there with the big prize. To even get a chance, one would have to do a whole lot of research, so to get a start, keep reading to learn about 30 ridiculously expensive coins worth way more than their face value.</p><h2 id=the-2007-godless-presidential-dollar><strong>The 2007 “Godless” Presidential Dollar</strong></h2><p><strong>via presidential-coins.com</strong></p><p>Okay, so compared to the other coins on this list, a simple dollar that’s actually worth around 50 bucks isn’t particularly impressive. However, it deserves distinction for the fact it’s significantly more recent than the others, not to mention the fact it has a pretty interesting origin story. Though minted in 2007, they’re all officially undated, and as the name would imply, <a href=#>the “In God We Trust” part featured on all U.S. currency was mysteriously left off</a>. Because they’re so new, hundreds of thousands of them exist, but give it a couple centuries and these unique pieces of history could skyrocket in value.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-1861-confederate-coins-are-historic-and-controversial><strong>The 1861 Confederate Coins Are Historic and Controversial</strong></h2><p><strong>via stockmarketsreview.com</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, the short-lived Confederate States of America are seen as a harsh reminder of the country’s dark past with the Civil War, but that doesn’t mean memorabilia from the rebellion isn’t extremely historically significant, and to the right collector, highly valuable. When the South seceded from the north, the new pseudo-nation needed it’s own currency to make things official, hence the 1861 Confederate half dollar.</p><p><strong>The war was over before they became commonplace, and in fact only a very small number were ever made, <a href=#>leading to price tags ranging from $630,000 $880,000</a>.</strong></p><p>Talk about being a valuable piece of history.</p><h2 id=the-1943-copper-head-is-one-pretty-penny><strong>The 1943 Copper Head Is One Pretty Penny</strong></h2><p><strong>via tqn.com</strong></p><p>Most people these days are probably aware that pennies are a rather tenuous form of currency. It’s cost more to produce them than they’re worth for years, but there are still some exceptions to the rule. In 1943, there was a different issue with pennies, in that the U.S. government needed all the copper they could find to manufacture items related to World War II. As such, most pennies at the time were made with steel, but somehow 40 of them fell through the cracks and got made out of copper, anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Nowadays, depending on the condition, those rare copper 1943 pennies can be worth $60,000 to $200,000.</strong></p><p>Who thought copper could be worth so much?</p><h2 id=the-1795-5-coin-was-the-first-american-currency-made-out-of-gold><strong>The 1795 $5 Coin Was the First American Currency Made Out of Gold</strong></h2><p><strong>via amazonaws.com</strong></p><p>Because gold is more expensive than any money people carry around in their pockets, the U.S. Mint eventually realized it shouldn’t continue making coins out of the precious metal. That wasn’t always the case, though, and in fact, gold was the basis of American money for roughly 150 years. The trend began in 1795 with this $5 piece, which is much less rare than many others on the list, yet still highly valuable due to the historical background it has.</p><p><strong>In good-enough condition, <a href=#>the right collector could pay $350,000 $645,000 for one of them</a>.</strong></p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if coins were still made of gold?</p><h2 id=the-1933-10-coin-ended-the-gold-standard><strong>The 1933 $10 Coin Ended the Gold Standard</strong></h2><p><strong>via coinvalues.com</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It probably goes without saying that even a very small chunk of gold is worth much more today than anything people keep in their wallets. This was especially true during the Great Depression, which is why in 1933, President FDR officially made it impossible for the U.S. Mint to continue creating gold coins, asking all citizens to turn over their own shimmering belongings for proper compensation. The last such piece pressed was this $10 coin, which almost immediately left circulation, most of them getting melted back into metal.</p><p><strong>A few survived, though, and they’re now worth up to $1 million if they're in good condition.</strong></p><p>Wouldn't it be nice to get our hands on one of those?</p><h2 id=the-1880-4-coin-only-lasted-2-years><strong>The 1880 $4 Coin Only Lasted 2 Years</strong></h2><p><strong>via amazonaws.com</strong></p><p>It’s hard enough for businesses to keep steady change for all types of currency that are now in existence, and it would be even more difficult if things like $4 coins were still around, further confusing the process. Understandably, things like this Coiled Hair Stella piece created in 1880 don’t exist anymore for this reason, and the fact it was made with 6 grams of actual gold further explain how they fell out of vogue. Of course, the few that survived have great value to collectors, <a href=#>possibly fetching as much as $1.5 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-1652-new-england-shilling-was-an-early-sign-of-american-independence><strong>The 1652 New England Shilling Was an Early Sign of American Independence</strong></h2><p><strong>via goodreads.com</strong></p><p>In the year 1652, the United States didn’t even exist yet, meaning any so-called American money from that time frame couldn’t technically exist. However, settlers were already colonizing the area, and some of them wished to separate themselves from England with their own currency. Only a few short decades after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, this very simple shilling piece was minted, simply containing the letters N.E. for “New England” and XII to signify it was worth 12 pence. Well, back then, anyway. Now, <a href=#>the few remaining New England shillings can be worth $250,000 to $500,000</a>.</p><h2 id=the-1994-2-000-chinese-yuan-is-a-true-unicorn><strong>The 1994 2,000 Chinese Yuan is a True Unicorn</strong></h2><p>via Numista</p><p>Believe it or not, while history and historical provenance will always be key to coin collectors, even some more modern designs are started to make hundreds of thousands of dollars. Part of the reason this 1994 Chinese 2,000 yuan coin is so expensive is that it’s made of .999 fine gold, and not only that, but the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation graded it an impressive 69 out of 70, making it nearly perfect to the even the highly-trained eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Only 18 of them exist overall, featuring a beautiful design of a unicorn, and <a href=#>experts say they’re worth $600 to $800,000</a>.</strong></p><h2 id=the-edward-iii-florin-is-the-most-expensive-british-coin><strong>The Edward III Florin Is the Most Expensive British Coin</strong></h2><p><strong>via en.wikimedia.org</strong></p><p>Long before America started putting Presidents on money, England was doing the same thing with their kings. During the 1300s, this meant most British coinage was commissioned in the name of King Edward III, including this ornate florin known as the “double leopard,” which was technically worth six shillings. Only three of them are still known to exist today, with the most valuable of all surprisingly found in 2006 by someone fiddling with a metal detector in an undisclosed location. Wherever it was, <a href=#>they ultimately made £460,000, or $605,000, for the discovery</a>.</p><h2 id=1794-liberty-cap-cent-is-worth-way-more-with-errors><strong>1794 Liberty Cap Cent Is Worth Way More With Errors</strong></h2><p><strong>via postrex.com</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone knows the phrase “mistakes are made,” and it has applied by the U.S. Mint from the very beginning. The plus side is that to a coin collector, a technical anomaly or imperfection can gradually cause the value of a given piece to shoot through the roof, as seen with the 1794 liberty cap cent, one of the very first pieces of currency in America. For whatever reason, the government decided to tweak the design from the coin’s first year to the next, but apparently, not everyone got the memo, leaving a few 1794 pennies with the leftover design from 1793. To the right collector, <a href=#>this error can be worth around $900,000</a>.</p><h2 id=the-1793-chain-cent-was-america-s-first-currency><strong>The 1793 Chain Cent Was America’s First Currency</strong></h2><p><strong>via amazonaws.com</strong></p><p>Between the U.S. Mint making a few test runs and actually creating the country’s original dollar, both of which this list will cover as it continues, the country mass produced it’s first original currency with the 1793 chain cent. In addition to a bust of George Washington with long, flowing hair, the coin gets it’s name from the design on its backside, with the words “One Cent” encased in a chain link. With how important this piece was to American history, <a href=#>it makes perfect sense that it would sell for just under $1 million</a>.</p><h2 id=the-1870-u-s-silver-dollar-was-made-as-a-piece-of-decoration><strong>The 1870 U.S. Silver Dollar Was Made as a piece of Decoration</strong></h2><p><strong>via coinsnumismatics.com</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of the reason it’s so hard for people to find any extremely rare coins hidden amongst their own spare change is that the truly valuable currency wasn’t always made for public consumption. Sure, the U.S. Mint made real silver dollars throughout the late 1800s, but the most special of all were 12 unique-coin experts now believe were most likely created as a decoration. That’s the only explanation why the government never officially listed these specimens, and it also explains why the edges were softer than on regular money. More importantly, these factors shot the value all the way up to $1 million.</p><h2 id=the-1992-gold-2-000-yuan-celebrates-the-great-wall><strong>The 1992 Gold 2,000 Yuan Celebrates the Great Wall</strong></h2><p><strong>via architecture-background.blogspot.com</strong></p><p>Important as rarity and age can be to a coin collector, one can’t underestimate the value of condition, which is often as important or more than mere age. Even to a non-collector, the aesthetics of the 1992 Gold 2,000 yuan alone are quite striking, made as part of a series to honor the greatest inventions and discoveries of Chinese history. Only 10 of the 2,000 yuan piece were ever made, specifically celebrating the compass and the country’s Great Wall, and containing a full kilogram of actual gold. To the right collector or Chinese history enthusiast, it can be worth $1.3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-1776-continental-silver-dollar-sparked-a-revolution><strong>The 1776 Continental Silver Dollar Sparked a Revolution</strong></h2><p><strong>via thehistoryblog.com</strong></p><p>The United States Constitution wasn’t written until 1787, followed by the election of George Washington as the nation’s first President two years later. For this reason, the “first U.S. currency” didn’t officially crop up until 1794, as this list will later elaborate. That said, as soon as the Declaration of Independence was written, some Founding Fathers thought it necessary for the budding nation to have its own coinage, hence the creation of the 1776 continental silver dollar.

While only 10 of the 1894 Barber dimes are still known to exist today, it’s said that the San Francisco mint actually made 2.5 million of them back when they were first produced. Amazingly, the economy was so horrible at the time that it made more financial sense to destroy all but 19 of these coins, making the select few survivors remarkably valuable and historic.

Created during the Second Boer War, the coin signified Dutch efforts to remain independent from English control in regards to their South African territories. After all, 1899 coins were confiscated by British authorities, <a href=#>President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic added a single “9” to coins from 1898 in an act of defiance</a>, to signify his reign wasn’t over. Eventually, the price of this single pound’s value shot up to 20 million rand, at the time equaling $4 million.</p><h2 id=the-1804-bowed-liberty-dollar-was-created-as-a-gift-that-was-never-delivered><strong>The 1804 Bowed Liberty Dollar Was Created as a Gift That Was Never Delivered</strong></h2><p><strong>via en.wikimedia.org</strong></p><p>Despite social morays, there are still plenty of people who feel cold hard cash makes for a pretty excellent gift.

That year, the U.S. mint decided to switch from the classic design to a new model featuring a Native American and bison. Mistakes were made, though, and somehow they also pressed 5 of the older version along with the new ones. Naturally, this made that nickel of nickels incredibly valuable, with four out of five winding up in museums to this day. The one that still gets circulated routinely goes for seven figures, as <a href=#>it was the first coin to sell for more than $1 million</a>, and the price tag later climbed to $5 million.</p><h2 id=the-1804-10-proof-eagle-was-made-as-a-reference><strong>The 1804 $10 Proof Eagle Was Made as a Reference</strong></h2><p><strong>via tangibleinvestmentsinc.com</strong></p><p>Interested as coin collectors are in the rarest pieces around, the governments that issue them also find great value in their creation. That’s made clear with the 1804 Proof Eagle, which was actually created around 1834 as an example of the type of currency the United States was making some 30 years prior. At that point, $10 coins were no longer being created, so the Director of the Mint decided to make a handful of replications to show various diplomats, of which only three are known to survive today. The rarity and historical explanation lead to a price tag of $5&nbsp;million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-723-umayyad-gold-dinar-is-over-a-millennium-old><strong>The 723 Umayyad Gold Dinar Is Over a Millennium Old</strong></h2><p><strong>via ieacoins.blogspot.com</strong></p><p>By and large, the coins on this list are pretty old, and their age has a lot to do with why they’re so valuable. On that logic, this Umayyad gold dinar from the year 723 is certainly the rarest of all, somehow surviving nearly 1,400 years. Given this seriously advanced age, it’s hard even for experts to figure out exactly where it was made and why, but a prevailing theory is that it commemorated the Caliph at the time taking his hajj to Mecca. As such, it’s incredibly valuable to the entire Islamic world, and <a href=#>fetched over $6.3 million at auction</a>.</p><h2 id=the-1787-brasher-doubloon-was-privately-made><strong>The 1787 Brasher Doubloon Was Privately Made</strong></h2><p><strong>via en.wikimedia.org</strong></p><p>Unique and rare as they are, the coins on this list were generally issued by the government and used as official currency. Not so for the 1787 Brasher Doubloon, which was actually something of a novelty item.

The American dollar was actually so weak that President FDR made possessing gold billions illegal, which was pretty unfortunate for the folks at the U.S. Mint who just created a bunch of Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle $20 coins. They were supposed to be destroyed, but about 20 of them were saved. Most eventually went back to the government, but one of them wound up in the hands of King Farouk I of Egypt. Decades after his passing, it was rediscovered and sold for $7,370,000.</p><h2 id=the-1794-flowing-hair-coin-was-the-usa-s-first-dollar><strong>The 1794 Flowing Hair Coin Was The USA’s First Dollar</strong></h2><p><strong>via en.wikimedia.org</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Compared to many other countries, the United States is still relatively young, making it one of the few places where the original dollar currency issued by the government still exists. Of course, after nearly 250 years, a good number of the 1794 Flowing Hair dollar coins have faded out of existence, and others are in pretty bad shape.
