But let's not be so quick to turn into the green-eyed monster.</p><p>Though this is at times the case, there are many times when a celebrity parent’s or family member’s success is too powerful or intense to overcome, so much so those celebrity children are left aimlessly chasing a dream that will pale in comparison or simply fall, <a href=#>defeated by the expectations and scrutiny of society</a> as their life completely derails.</p><p>To find out 22 Hollywood kids who were crushed by their family’s fame, keep on reading.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/was-adam-sandler-s-daughter-sadie-pressured-to-become-an-actor-and-hollywood-s-next-nepo-baby_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Was Adam Sandler's Daughter Sadie Pressured To Become An Actor And Hollywood's Next Nepo Baby?">Was Adam Sandler's Daughter Sadie Pressured To Become An Actor And Hollywood's Next Nepo Baby?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It is unclear if Adam Sandler's Daughter Sadie chose to become an actor or if was it based on her father's influence in the industry.</p><p><strong>Update October 2023: </strong>It can be difficult to come out from behind the shadows of a famous parent or parents to start a career. While some rely on nepotism to open doors, others choose to forge a path of their own. Regardless of which direction is taken, there is no guarantee to have the same level of success as Mom and/or Dad.</p><p>Those who struggle to gain notoriety like their parents did, can go on to suffer from mental health issues. Or perhaps mental health issues pre-existed and the rejection or just moments in the spotlight cause them to grow out of control. When this happens, things like substance abuse can run rampant, putting an end to the career that some children of celebrity parents so desperately want to have.</p><p>While some do go on to have amazing careers that eventually outshine their parents, this is the exception, not the rule. But hopefully, even if the same level of success is not realized, dreams continue to be chased by those who want to entertain for a living.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ava-sambora><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>Ava Sambora</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar48861479-1.jpg><p>Daughter of Richie Sambora of the band Bon Jovi, and actress Heather Locklear, Ava Sambora has not quite been able to reach the level of fame that her parents have in the world of entertainment.</p><p>Sambora is still an aspiring actress though, with just five projects to her credit.</p><h2 id=justin-combs><span class=item-num>21 </span><span>Justin Combs</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50062595-1.jpg><p>Justin Combs, son of rapper Sean Combs better known as Diddy, bypassed a career in entertainment, instead of attending the University of California, Los Angeles on a football scholarship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, the team’s former coach Rick Neuheisel admitted that Combs had likely received the scholarship because of his father’s fame.</p><p>To make matters worse, the most recent thing that has happened to Justin is that he was arrested for suspicion of DUI in June 2023.
