Maynard, 54, had been a suspect in one murder and several car hijackings across Ohio and Virginia. As the subject of a widespread police search, he had reportedly taken several hostages and sought refuge in a West Virginia gas station in an attempt to evade arrest.</p><p>During the standoff with law enforcement, officials resorted to shooting Maynard, subsequently transporting the wounded suspect to a local hospital. However, medical professionals pronounced him dead shortly after his arrival. Thankfully, none of the hostages involved in the situation sustained any major injuries, according to Newsweek.</p><p>The chain of events began on Saturday, September 9, when David Maynard allegedly committed a murder, taking the life of his stepfather in Ironton, Ohio. Authorities revealed that following this heinous act, the suspect had also restrained his ex-girlfriend before fleeing the crime scene.</p><p>Dan Johnson, the police chief of Ironton, described the discovery of the victim’s ex-girlfriend at the murder scene, saying, “They heard a woman screaming for help inside. So, they forced their way into the rear door, got inside, and found the woman. She was tied up in a bedroom there.”</p><p>Continuing to recount the incident, Johnson added, “A 39-year-old female was tied up using cords, and [officers] cut her loose, then proceeded to clear the rest of the house and they found a 78-year-old male deceased.”</p><p>During his escape, David Maynard reportedly abducted a woman and commandeered her vehicle. Eventually, he abandoned the car near a Dollar General store, leaving the woman behind. Law & Crime reported this development.</p><p>Sgt. Lee Pennington spotted David Maynard at a Speedway Gas Station in Ceredo, West Virginia, where the tense standoff unfolded. When Maynard realized he had been sighted by Sgt. Pennington, he brandished a firearm at the officer before seeking refuge inside the gas station.</p><p>Within the gas station, Maynard took three individuals hostage, including the store clerk and two other customers. As the situation escalated, law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and initiated negotiations with the suspect. At a certain point during the negotiations, Maynard agreed to release two of the hostages.</p><p>However, when the suspect exited the building, officers resorted to lethal force, fatally shooting him. Emergency responders swiftly transported the critically wounded gunman to a nearby hospital, where medical professionals confirmed his demise due to the injuries sustained.</p><p>Following David Maynard’s death, West Virginia State Police Captain R.A. Maddy declared the incident as resolved. Maddy also conveyed that none of the hostages or police officers involved in the confrontation had sustained injuries during the standoff.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKmt02abopxdma63tcNmpJqxnpa%2FpXnDqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendie-malick-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Wendie Malick Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
