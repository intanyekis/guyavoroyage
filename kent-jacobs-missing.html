1960, in Hope Mills, Cumberland County, North Carolina, was the eldest of five siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he was a special needs individual with an intellectual capacity comparable, Kent’s family treated him with love and equality.&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up in a close-knit community where children freely roamed the neighborhood, Kent was an integral part of the vibrant social fabric.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The mystery of Kent Jacobs missing</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s a story about a missing North Carolina man named Kent Jacobs and his family's unrelenting search for answers…</p><p>Listen to Season 2 Episode 1 of the <a href=#>#Dateline</a> <a href=#>#MissingInAmerica</a> podcast with <a href=#>@JoshMankiewicz</a>, for free, wherever you get your podcasts. <a href=#>https://t.co/i8VddD28yG</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KJF4SRuzt7</a></p>— Dateline NBC (@DatelineNBC) <a href=#>May 30, 2023</a><p>On March 10, 2002, just days before his 42nd birthday, Kent went for an evening walk to meet some friends and never returned.&nbsp;</p><p>His sister, Jackie, who was away in Seattle then, immediately sensed something was wrong when their mother informed her of Kent’s failure to come home.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerned and determined, Jackie flew back to Hope Mills to assist her mother in the search for her missing brother.</p><p>Despite extensive search operations conducted by local law enforcement, community members, and various resources, no trace of Kent Jacobs has ever been discovered.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities carefully searched the area, leaving no stone unturned, but the lack of tangible evidence or credible leads added to the mystery surrounding Kent’s disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Speculation about what transpired began to circulate, but without concrete proof, the mystery remained intact, and the family’s pain persisted.</p><p>Despite a court declaring Kent Jacobs legally dead in 2012, his family remains committed to finding him and uncovering the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cumberland County Police Department continues to investigate the case, with Detective Patrice Bogertey confirming an active and open investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite exhausting nearly all available avenues to locate him, their efforts yielded no significant leads.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackie recounted her extensive outreach to multiple missing persons’ organizations and even personally contacted the FBI.</p><p>Nonetheless, she expressed her frustration with the fact that Kent was legally an adult at the time of his disappearance, limiting the assistance that authorities could provide initially.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2023, a three-day search was conducted at one of the last places Kent was seen walking past during his visits with childhood friends, but it yielded no breakthroughs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Theories behind Kent Jacobs missing</h2><p>While the exact circumstances of Kent Jacobs missing remains unknown, his family has expressed their suspicions regarding a potential robbery.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, Kent would only carry around $20 with him, but on the day he went missing, he had $200, which was his paycheck.</p><p>Kent’s family had placed him in a group home in Fayetteville designed for individuals with special needs.&nbsp;</p><p>From Monday to Friday, he lived and worked there, and his mother would pick him up every Friday afternoon to spend the weekend at home.</p><p>Another theory suggests the rising drug problem in the neighborhood could be connected to his disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, no conclusive evidence has surfaced to substantiate these theories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The reward announcement for Kent Jacobs missing case</h2><p>During the <a href=#>episode</a>, Jackie made an exclusive announcement stating her intention to offer a $15,000 cash reward to anyone who can provide information that leads to the discovery of Kent’s whereabouts.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, she is prepared to offer a substantial sum of $100,000 as a reward if the information provided results in the identification, arrest, and conviction of those responsible for her brother’s disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside these efforts, the Jacobs family established a nonprofit organization called The Kent Jacobs Foundation, aimed at assisting other families facing similar circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the passage of many years, she maintains hope that someone from the community will step forward with vital information, ultimately offering the family the closure they have been desperately seeking.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p
