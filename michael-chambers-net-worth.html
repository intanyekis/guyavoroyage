According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Chambers’ net worth is as high as $300,000, an amount earned through his successful acting career, which started in 1984. In addition to being an actor, Chambers also worked as a dancer, which improved his wealth.</p><h3>Michael Chambers Net Worth $300,000</h3><p>Michael Chambers was born as the youngest of four children and grew up in a community of mixed ethnic groups and cultures. From an early age, he became interested in dancing, so he had some roles in commercials before he appeared in the video for Lionel Richie’s “All Night Long” in the early ‘80s.</p><p>Chambers’ first on-screen credit came in 1984 in Joel Silberg’s musical comedy called “Breakin’”, in the role of Tony “Turbo”, a story about a young jazz dancer who meets a pair of break-dancers. The film became quite popular all over the globe, and grossed more than $57 million worldwide, which also helped Chambers to increase his net worth significantly. Also in 1984, the sequel “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo” came out, in which Michael co-starred alongside <a href=#>Lucinda Dickey</a> and <a href=#>Adolfo Quinones</a> as one of three street dancers who are trying to stop the destruction of a community recreational center. Although the movie didn’t repeat the success of its predecessor, it still gained popularity among teenagers in the US.</p><p>In 1987, Chambers appeared in an episode of “The Dom DeLuise Show”, while from 1990 to 1991, he was M.C. Mike – Announcer in eight episodes of the show called “Fox’s Fun House”. In 1991, Michael had a smaller role as Good Robot Bill in Peter Hewitt’s comedy “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” starring <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a>, <a href=#>Alex Winter</a> and William Sadler, and from 1991 to 1994, he played in four episodes of the Primetime Emmy Award-nominated TV series “Family Matters”, and then appeared alongside <a href=#>Leslie Nielsen</a> in Peter Segal’s “Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult” (1994).</p><p>Chambers’ latest on-screen appearance occurred in 1999 in Hugh Wilson’s film called “Dudley Do-Right” with <a href=#>Brendan Fraser</a>, <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, and <a href=#>Alfred Molina</a> in lead roles.</p><p>Since the start of the 2000s, Michael has focused on other ventures, and hasn’t been active as an actor. However, most recently he returned to the entertainment industry, and at the moment he is filming “Good Vibration” and “Break Dance Revolution”, both of which will be released in 2018.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Michael Chambers has a son, but the details about his marital status are unknown.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.550185873606><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$300,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 13, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Long Beach, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Dancer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/michael.b.chambers</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/boogaloo_shrimp?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0150400/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26229508196721><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-chambers-mn0000455560</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>“Breakin'” (1984), “Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo” (1984), “Jasper”, “Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey” (1991), “Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy” (2010, documentary)</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Fun House” (U.S. game show, 1990-1991), “Star Search” (1986), “Dance Hits '99” (2000), “Break Dance Revolution” (2018), “The Dom DeLuise Show (1987), “Family Matters” (1991-1992), “Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films” (2014)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Has one son.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>You can see Michael Chambers strut his break dancing moves on Sugar Ray's 1997 hit song music video, "FLY".</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=6><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Break Dance Revolution</td><td></td><td>pre-production</td><td>Shrimp</td></tr><tr><td>The Roundabout</td><td></td><td>announced</td><td>Shrimp</td></tr><tr><td>Foursome</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Bachelor #3</td></tr><tr><td>I Got Soul</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>James Brown (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Dudley Do-Right</td><td>1999</td><td></td><td>Dancer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult</td><td>1994</td><td></td><td>Dancer</td></tr><tr><td>Family Matters</td><td>1991-1994</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Urkelbot / Emile</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey</td><td>1991</td><td></td><td>Good Robot Bill (as Michael 'Shrimp' Chambers)</td></tr><tr><td>Fox's Fun House</td><td>1990-1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>M.C.
