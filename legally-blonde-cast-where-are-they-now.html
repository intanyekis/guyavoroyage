Blair made a celebratory post as well, adding that she was “too busy hanging out with Matt Davis talking in my trailer, or watching Reese work” to be <a href=#>snapping too many pics on</a> set.</p><p>Two years after the release of the original film, Witherspoon returned in Legally Blonde 2, which followed her character’s journey as an animal rights activist. A musical adaptation hit the stage in 2007 and Witherspoon coproduced a spinoff called Legally Blondes, starring twin sisters <strong>Milly</strong> and <strong>Becky Rosso</strong> playing Elle’s younger cousins.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Plus, <a href=#>Legally Blonde 3 is underway</a>.
