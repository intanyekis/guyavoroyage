Michael Jackson Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
You could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This song tells a story of a woman named Annie who gets attacked by a smooth criminal who came into her apartment. The song portrays an intense and violent scene that includes a crescendo sound and bloodstains on the carpet. Annie tries to escape, but she is unsuccessful, and she dies. Michael Jackson asks if Annie is okay, even though it is evident that she is not. The song ends with Michael asking the audience to leave the room.</p><br><p>The song has been interpreted in different ways, and some people believe that it is a commentary on the state of the world and how it can be a dangerous place for women. The mention of "Mouth to mouth resuscitation" and "sounding heartbeats, intimidation" may also suggest that the attacker tried to revive Annie after the attack. This interpretation could be seen as a reflection of how abusers often rely on their victims' dependence on them to maintain control.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>As he came into the window</u><br>The perpetrator broke into the victim's apartment through a window</p><br><p><u>Was a sound of a crescendo</u><br>The sound of the perpetrator's actions was building up to a climax</p><br><p><u>He came into her apartment</u><br>The perpetrator entered the victim's apartment</p><br><p><u>He left the bloodstains on the carpet</u><br>The perpetrator caused bleeding and left behind evidence</p><br><p><u>She ran underneath the table</u><br>The victim feared for her life and hid under a table</p><br><p><u>You could see she was unable</u><br>The victim was too scared to flee or fight back</p><br><p><u>So she ran into the bedroom</u><br>The victim fled to the bedroom for safety</p><br><p><u>She was struck down, it was her doom</u><br>The victim was attacked and killed</p><br><p><u>Annie, are you ok?
