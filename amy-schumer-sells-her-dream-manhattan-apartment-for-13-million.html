Though it had some interest, she failed to find a buyer for the property until recently, but only after slashing the asking price by $2 million. Amy owned the condo for less than a decade after buying it in 2016 for $12.15 million.</p><p>The luxury apartment certainly isn’t lacking in amenities. With over 4,500 square feet of living space, it comes with 5 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Former Bond Girl Eva Green Wins $1 Million Over Failed Movie 'A Patriot'</a></span></p><p>But what’s rare for a New York abode is that the penthouse also offers a lot of outdoor space, largely thanks to its rooftop garden. It also has a terrace that wraps around the apartment, offering stunning skyline views.</p><p><a href=#>Speaking to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Amy previously referred to the home as her “dream” apartment and detailed how impactful it was when she bought the place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m someone who came from having to share a bed with my mom,” the comedian revealed. “We had no money.” Amy added, “[Buying the penthouse was a] big deal for me. It felt like such a palace.”</p><p>Amy may only be saying goodbye to her penthouse now, but she bought a new property last year where she’s been residing full-time with her husband, Chris Fischer, and their young son.</p><p>At the end of June, it was reported the couple were <a href=#>considering putting an offer on the penthouse used in </a>Moonstruck, the 1978-Oscar winning movie starring Cher and Nicolas Cage. Located in Brooklyn Heights, Chris and Amy eventually bought the apartment for $11 million, after it was listed for $12.85 earlier in the year.</p><p>With over 5,500 square feet of living space, Amy’s new apartment is more spacious than her previous one. It features 5 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Originally built in 1829 (then likely renovated in the later 19th century to get that third story and Mansard roof), this house on one of the best streets in BK Heights has historic charm AND a connection to Cher, so really the package cannot get more complete," Robert Khederian, the real estate agent representing the listing, wrote of the property on Instagram.</p><p>"Love the federal fireplaces and woodwork in the double parlor. The kitchen is beautiful, the bathrooms make you smile, and there’s a dressing room you could spend all day in. That’s amore!" he continued.</p><p>Amy may feel say about selling her original New York apartment, but it surely can’t be too difficult give the luxurious pad she and her family now calls their full-time home.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kardashians Targeted For Robbery, Prompts Community To Increase Security</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaapaliwKS01Kacq2Wjmrmtv4yhnKtllKeyormMppinoJGpwaK6jJqnmqqkorKvwIyfpqtlYWh6rrXLpaCopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-gholston-net-worth-how-rich-is-william-gholston.html><span>←</span><span>William Gholston Net Worth: How rich is William Gholston?</span></a>
