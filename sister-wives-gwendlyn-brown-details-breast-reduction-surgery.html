The funny part is I wanted them to be even smaller.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Gwendlyn’s post comes a few days after she casually mentioned the surgery in a YouTube video and fans began asking questions. The Utah native has been candid about her life and family via her social media accounts, often recapping various episodes of Sister Wives for her followers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>On Wednesday, January 11, the TV personality shared via her YouTube that she is rooting for her mom and <a href=#><strong>Janelle Brown</strong></a> to team up for their own show following their respective splits from Kody.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I think <a href=#>we should have a spinoff series where Janelle and my mom</a> get together,” Gwendlyn said in the clip, joking that the women should take their close friendship a step further. “Tell me you don’t love that idea. …&nbsp;<i class=x_ContentPasted0>Sister Wives</i>. It should be called Sister&nbsp;<i class=x_ContentPasted0>Wives</i>&nbsp;— I’m a f—king genius.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>As Gwendlyn watched back season 17, episode 4, she pointed out that her mom and Janelle, 53, are “besties” and a “little duo” who always have each other’s backs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Christine publicly announced her split&nbsp;from Kody in November 2021. Janelle, for her part, revealed in December 2022 that she and the Wyoming native had been “separated for months.” (The estranged couple share six children: <a href=#><strong>Logan</strong>, 28, <strong>Maddie</strong>, 27, <strong>Hunter</strong>, 25, <strong>Garrison</strong>, 24, <strong>Gabriel</strong>, 21 and <strong>Savanah</strong>, 18</a>.)</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I’m not waiting for him. I’ve kind of mourned that that part of our life is gone,” Janelle said during part 3 of the Sister Wives: One-on-One special, which aired on January 8. “I wasn’t heartbroken. It wasn’t heartbreaking for me like it was for Christine.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Despite their split from the patriarch, the <a href=#>two women have remained close confidants</a> as they begin the next chapters of their lives, with Christine even&nbsp;praising Janelle for being her support system amid all their family drama.&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“She’s come to visit me several times. I have a guest room and she stays in the guest room, and her sister also lives about a half an hour from me,” Christine exclusively told Us Weekly&nbsp;in October 2022 of her dynamic with the real estate agent. “So <a href=#>she’ll see her and then she loves seeing [my daughters]</a> Aspyn and Mykelti and the baby and all of it. So we’ve gone on a couple of trips together too.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Kody, meanwhile, has also since separated from first wife <a href=#><strong>Meri Brown</strong></a>. The pair shared a joint statement about the split earlier this month after hinting at their relationship status during the December 2022 season 17 tell-all. The polygamist is still married to<a href=#><strong> Robyn Brown</strong></a>, whom <a href=#>he legally wed</a> in 2014.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoaOpsrN51qKtnqtdnMSmusOlsKdlkqe8uLqMnZytmZmhwG6u0Z6YrKxdp7KlwcKtoKimXajCs7PEq7Bo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sebastian-marroquin.html><span>←</span><span>Sebastian Marroquin</span></a>
