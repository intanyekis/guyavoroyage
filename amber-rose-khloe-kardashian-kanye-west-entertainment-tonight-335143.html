In a recent interview with <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, she revealed she has no bad blood against the Kardashian clan. She also went on to address <a href=# id=auto-tag_kanye-west_2 data-tag=kanye-west>Kanye West</a>’s infamous <a href=#>“30 showers”&nbsp;statement</a> on The Breakfast Club.</p><p>The feud between <a href=#>Khloe and Muva</a>&nbsp;started back in February when Amber went on The Breakfast Club and addressed how she felt about Kylie Jenner and Tyga’s relationship.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous,” Rose said of the alleged relationship. “[Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.”</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>Amber Rose Is Organizing A ‘SlutWalk’ For Women’s Equality</a></strong></p><p>Amber admitted, however, that this scuffle could have been prevented had she not stated her opinion on Khloe’s younger sister’s relationship.</p><p>“I could have totally minded my own business when it came to her sister,” Rose explained. “But, me being a dancer at such a young age, dealing with older men gave me the humility and knowledge to speak on such a subject. (Yet) I can understand why it came across the wrong way to her. I get it. But, that’s a phone call she could have had with me.”</p><p>Then the 31 year-old model later went on to profess how she felt about Kanye’s statement.</p><p>“We were happy when we were together!” Rose said. “And now all of the sudden, I’m getting slut-shamed because we’re not together anymore and it’s not fair.”</p><p>Watch Amber Rose discuss the Kardashians, Kanye West and her upcoming SlutWalk above. – Richy Rosario</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a6o7HRZqmoq5ViuKm4zp5kpJmima60tMiapWajkaPGpnnWnqqtZZWjwaa%2B05qgp6WVo8FuwM6noKCgpGKAdIGQbWpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-reasons-why-the-rock-outshines-vin-diesel.html><span>←</span><span>20 Reasons Why The Rock Outshines Vin Diesel</span></a>
