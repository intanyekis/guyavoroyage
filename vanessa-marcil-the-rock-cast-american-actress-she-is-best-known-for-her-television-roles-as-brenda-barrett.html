Brian’s partner on the dance floor is his girlfriend Shanna Burgess.</p><p>A post on Vanessa’s grid shows a photo of her 19-year-old son Kassius on his way to the studio to watch a live DWTS recording. “On the way to Dad. #TeamGreen,” wrote Vanessa, 52, who split from Brian, 48, in 2003.</p><p>She also posted a screenshot of Kassius’ fans watching Brian and Sharna show off their stuff, along with the hashtags #DWTS and #TeamGreen.</p><p>To the photo of Cassius in the car, one of Vanessa’s followers commented, “I wish I could live together as gracefully and peacefully as you!” This prompted Vanessa to reply, “God help us all people” and added the Praying Hands emoji.</p><p>That’s a little far-fetched from Vanessa’s previously posted public comments about the Beverly Hills 90210 alumni. Back in November 2020, Brian’s ex-wife Megan Fox made it clear that she didn’t like the actor’s Instagram photos of himself and their 5-year-old son from the trip in Halloween costumes. At the time, Meghan made a comment on the post, accusing Brian of using her baby to “pose on Instagram” and “feeding on the popular narrative that I’m an absent mother.”</p><p>On the same day, Vanessa posted on her Instagram: “Like I said…the truth always comes out…” The general hospital alumna added the caption, “#ImWithYouSister.”</p><p>Back in 2018, Vanessa claimed on Instagram that Brian and Meghan had largely cut Cassius out of their lives, in part because the teen had “been unpopular for 5 years” .” Brian and Meghan have not publicly responded to the allegations, but it now appears the drama is a thing of the past.</p><p>It’s great to see Brian – who also shares Meghan’s Noah, 8, and Bodhi, 7 – have a lot of support for his DWTS run as he has some room for improvement in the ballroom.</p><p>In this week’s premiere, he scored 24 out of 40, just shy of current leader JoJo Siwa, who scored 29.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGitmqaVqMCiecyaqZyhnGLBqbGMq6aco12YrrTAjJqknqqZmK6vecCcq6udo6h6tLTEZqCsZZKawLV5yqemsKZdm7yzeceeqWaslaGyt7XSoqanZaKkuaa%2FjJqqZpqimrulrYybmKuqlanBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swifts-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-is-dismissed-again.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swifts Copyright Infringement Lawsuit Is Dismissed (Again)</span></a>
