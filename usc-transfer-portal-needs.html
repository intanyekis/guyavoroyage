So let‚Äôs examine where USC could bring in more help to achieve what it couldn‚Äôt last season ‚Äî a Pac-12 title and College Football Playoff berth.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Rush end</h2><p>The media doesn‚Äôt get to watch 11-on-11 portions of practice, but from the drills we do see, it‚Äôs clear USC needs more bodies at rush end. The Trojans will have <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Romello Height</a>, who opened last season as the starter at rush end, back for preseason camp, which will help. But Height missed last season after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 2 and has had shoulder issues in the past, so it‚Äôs not like it can be assumed he will be available for a full season.</p><p>USC was active trying to address this spot earlier this offseason. The staff pursued <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Coastal Carolina</a> transfer <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Josaiah Stewart</a> heavily, but he chose <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Michigan</a>, and the Trojans added <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Georgia State</a> transfer <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jamil Muhammad</a>.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Braylan Shelby</a>, a top-100 prospect and a four-star signee, arrives in the summer but would have to adjust to the college game and pick up the defense extremely quickly to make an immediate impact.</p><p>For a defense that needs more production from its pass rush, this position could be a target if a quality player enters the portal.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That‚Äôs a wrap from the 2023 Spring Game!</p><p>See you in the fall, <a href=#>#TrojanFamily</a>!<a href=#>#FightOn</a> | <a href=#>@WellsFargo</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0klSJ9W6XZ</a></p><p>‚Äî USC Football ‚úåÔ∏è (@uscfb) <a href=#>April 15, 2023</a></p><h2>Defensive line</h2><p>The Trojans hit this position hard during the first portal window and pulled in solid additions like <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anthony Lucas</a> (Texas A&M), <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Sullivan</a> (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Purdue</a>) and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kyon Barrs</a> (Arizona). It‚Äôs difficult to imagine any of those players matching the production of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a>-bound defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu, who led the nation with 13.5 sacks and amassed 22 TFLs. But those additions should raise the level of play for USC‚Äôs defensive line.</p><p>That said, this group could still benefit from more size and depth, particularly along the interior. Look at the Trojans schedule. It‚Äôs back-loaded, and there are several physical offenses on the slate during the second half of the season.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>At 6 feet 2, 290 pounds, Barrs is a physical and athletic presence that USC didn‚Äôt have in the middle of its defensive line last season, but he‚Äôs only one player. The Trojans need more like him.</p><p>Georgia defensive lineman Bear Alexander, a highly touted prospect in the 2022 recruiting cycle, <a href=#>is expected to enter the portal</a>, and there‚Äôs been plenty of speculation connecting him to USC.</p><p>At 6 feet 3, 305 pounds, Alexander would fit exactly what the Trojans need.</p><h2>Offensive line</h2><p>Last week, offensive lineman <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Andrew Milek</a> confirmed that his fellow lineman Courtland Ford plans to enter the transfer portal. Ford started at left tackle during the 2021 season and opened last season as the starter there. His role was reduced when he suffered an ankle injury and he wasn‚Äôt projected as a starter this year.</p><p>That‚Äôs still a hit to USC‚Äôs depth on the offensive line. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mason Murphy</a> is the team‚Äôs No. 3 tackle but needs to become more consistent. Florida transfer <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ethan White</a> signed with the program in January, and the assumption is he‚Äôd slot in at left guard, but he has yet to enroll.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welcome to the family, <a href=#>@ethanwhite79</a> üò§‚úåÔ∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/71bCcz1sGr</a></p><p>‚Äî USC Football ‚úåÔ∏è (@uscfb) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></p><p>The Trojans should be fine at tackle, though adding another couldn‚Äôt hurt. But they could use more depth at guard. Depending on one of the four incoming freshmen to get on the two-deep is a tough ask.</p><p>Every other offensive position seems to be stocked well and has good numbers.</p><h2>Where could USC suffer attrition?</h2><p>There have been three departures since the start of spring ‚Äî tight end Malcolm Epps, corner Joshua Jackson Jr., who entered the portal on Friday, and Ford. It seems likely there will be more. USC‚Äôs receivers are talented, but the position is also crowded, so it could potentially be difficult to keep them all, as evidenced earlier this offseason when the Trojans lost <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kyle Ford</a>, Gary Bryant Jr., C.J. Williams and John Jackson III.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Some players have yet to contribute on the field along the offensive line, defensive line and in the secondary and have been with the program for several years. Those players who have limited playing time and don‚Äôt seem to be in an ideal spot on the two-deep are worth monitoring.</p><h2>What is USC‚Äôs scholarship situation?</h2><p>Counting White and USC‚Äôs other incoming signees, the Trojans are at the limit of 85 scholarship players, according to The Athletic‚Äôs unofficial count. That could be 84 depending on whether kicker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Denis Lynch</a> is on scholarship. Either way, if USC is going to add players this spring, that means some players need to go.</p><p>At this time last year, the Trojans were at about 78 scholarship players and added critical players to their roster such as receiver Jordan Addison, linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Eric Gentry</a>, corner <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jacobe Covington</a> and rush end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Solomon Byrd</a>.</p><p>USC doesn‚Äôt have as many needs as it did then. The roster is in better shape. But there are still holes that need to be addressed. We‚Äôll see if this spring is as productive as last year for the Trojans in the portal.</p><p>(Photo of Lincoln Riley: Kiyoshi Mio / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k21ocW5lZnxzfJFsZmlsX2aEcMHSnGStqpGjwKex0WanqKqklrluusSem6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./famous-country-singers-net-worth-lowest-ranked.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>These Famous Country Singers Don't Have Nearly As Much Money As You Think</span></a>
